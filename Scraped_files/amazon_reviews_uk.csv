While the phones were good, the refurbishment was poor.
Phones cam back with eSIMs still registered and various different Android versions."

Battery life is stellar, I can get 1 to 1.5 days easily with moderate usage and it looks perfect, people always think I have an iPhone 16 Pro when they see the phone which is a good thing as it has a flat screen and very easy to hold."
"Google Pixel 9 Pro - Unlocked Android Smartphone with Gemini, Triple Rear Camera System, 24-Hour Battery, and 6.3"" Super Actua Display - Hazel, 128GB",Visit the Google Store,Tech Reviewer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2024,"A very high quality phone, but not without its quirks.","Let me preface this by saying that I love Android phones, and I myself have had a Pixel phone in the past (specifically, Pixel 4 XL, which I still own).

I won't go over the specs as that's all known information, I'll give a rundown of the things that I like versus things I dislike.

1. First of all build quality, it feels PREMIUM (and at this price-tag, it definitely should be). It hurts putting a case on this, but it's an evil necessity to prevent damage/scratches as much as possible.

2. The screen is VERY fluid, 120hz feels really good. Everything opens and scrolls nicely, I love the vanilla Google experience. I'm a big Google user so having my Gmail, Youtube, Keep Notes, Drive and all those other apps as a baseline is amazing.

3. Photos are amazing as always by Google. This is pretty subjective but I've always been a fan of Google's photo outputs, and this is no different. I will say that I still had some issue with video recording lag on the highest quality. I've also noted that if you constantly take photos in quick succession, the camera app and phone DOES start to lag and fall behind, and this is very noticeable.

4. I'm not a big fan of the push to Gemini, I have already ran into issues with the AI to request things, open things or even take notes. A quick example is a shopping list note, it will tell me that it's taken it but in actuality it hasn't. I do miss the old Google Assistant, I think they're trying to rely too much on AI whereas some things ""should"" be delegated to Google Assistant.

I don't have much more to add, the rest of the phone has all the functions you expect. I do like that the biometrics is pretty much instant now (a single tap and in you are). Great phone all in all, but is it worth Â£1000? I don't think so (in my eyes, no phone is worth that much).

As a side note for those with kids, this runs games like Roblox very fluidly, I've also tried some other mobile games such as CoD, Diablo Immortal and the experience is very fluid, no FPS issues at all.

"Google Pixel 9 Pro - Unlocked Android Smartphone with Gemini, Triple Rear Camera System, 24-Hour Battery, and 6.3"" Super Actua Display - Hazel, 128GB",Visit the Google Store,Ginginho,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2025,Why the huge black bar at the top?,"It's a nice, smooth phone, coming from the Pixel 7a the camera is a nice upgrade. A couple of things that annoy me more than they should: the curved screen isn't a good look, either aesthetically or during use. Most annoying is the huge black bar where the clock and battery icons are found. It's at least 50% bigger than it should be. You spend a lot of money on a quality screen, only for Google to mark 10% of it out of bounds. Nasty."
"Google Pixel 9 Pro - Unlocked Android Smartphone with Gemini, Triple Rear Camera System, 24-Hour Battery, and 6.3"" Super Actua Display - Hazel, 128GB",Visit the Google Store,A Hall,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 November 2024,Brilliant,"Love this phone, bit I am an avid Android junkie too! Fast processor that hasn't run hot for me yet. The camera is sublime. best I've had yet - but I did upgrade forma so-so Sony Xperia 1ii. The photo editing options are brilliant and very effective.

Battery is ok, about 24 to 36 hours with moderate usage which for me is streaming a 1 hour boxset/movie, listening to music for 2 hours per day and general browsing on social media / web for up to 5 hours. I also have GPS and Bluetooth on as well, plus anti-virus running in the background.

Face and finger recognition in the main area very good. I'd say the former being better than the latter for me.

Phone is a slightly heavier in the hand than my Sony but not so much that it aches. Just have to two-hander it every now and then.

Love the hazel colour as well, more grey and less in my view, does depend on the light though. Work for me.

It goes without saying that you a case and screen / rear camera protector are a must-have.

Overall, really pleased - especially with the 7 years of software updates too.
