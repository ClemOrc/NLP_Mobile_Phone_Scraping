1ikpwsz,GooglePixel,My thoughts on the Pixel 9 Pro XL,"Warning: negative experience ahead. Fanboys beware.

The Pixel 9 Pro XL is my first pixel device. I was always fascinated by Pixels since the first release, but I never got one since it's not officially sold in my region.
When the Pixel 9 came out and the reviews said it was finally able to compete with other flagships I was excited.
I finally got my hands on one and I've been using it exclusively since october. Everything was perfect at the start. The phone felt premium. The fingerprint sensor worked as well as my Samsung's. The UI was buttery with the smoothest animations I've ever seen on a phone. It was everything I wanted from a phone.

But as time went on I started to notice annoyances that have cumulatively turned me off for good. Mostly software issues that kept getting worse and/or  never fixed through updates.

- Let's start with a simple one. My pixel was improted from Japan. The camera sounds cannot be turned off due to regulations there. Other phones will enable the option if you have an international SIM card. My SIM is not japanese and my google account is not associated with japan in any way so why is the option still disabled.

- Gemini advanced free 1 year trial failed to activate on my account, and I tried 2 other accounts to no avail.

- The phone can't handle rotations with gesture controls. Many many times when I switch to portrait from landscape the gesture bar will stay at the side until I swipe home from the side, then the screen will flash and get fixed.

- Sometimes when I copy my credit card number it only pastes the last 4 digits? very bizzare and sounds like an app specific issue but my Samsung never did this.

- The camera is far worse than I expected. I used a Samsung Galaxy S23U with GCAM mod and it was easily better. I just hated that it was slow and I had to switch to the default app for video and other modes.

- The camera processing is very bad in certain situations. Like zoom, night mode, and worst of all, night mode zoom shots. The photo comes out looking incredible for half a second before the final processed image is shown. Look up a video titled ""GCam v9.6 Destroyed My Pixel Camera"" by @IDTR on youtube. I'm not the only one who noticed.

- I was filming a concert the other day and in one video the camera froze for 5 seconds when I switched lenses, the outright crashed when i switched again. Very frustrating.
- Telephoto RAW files are very soft with bloom effect, I thought my lense was smudged in the beginning. JPEGs looks fine but RAWs are affected and it's very difficult to fix in Lightroom.

- Video stabilization is very jumpy. It will stabilize well and stay in one place while panning then suddenly jump to the side. Very strange behavior.

These are some of the issues off the top of my head, but I'm sure there are more.

Overall, most of the issues range from minor to hindrance but not deal breakers, until you count how many there are. I find this inexcusable for a flagship device. I've had better experience from beta releases of customs ROMs before. I still hope one day we will actually get a perfect Pixel phone but the Pixel 9 is not it. I thought I will keep mine for a few years but I'm already looking for alternatives.",2025-02-08 15:36:00,0,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ikpwsz/my_thoughts_on_the_pixel_9_pro_xl/

1ijk8r5,GooglePixel,Home wifi router keeps crashing when using Google Pixel 9,"Hello Reddit!

My partner and I are experiencing a weird issue that we are nowhere near qualified to fix.

My partner recently got the new Google Pixel 9 and it keeps causing our router at home to crash and restart. It happens constantly! We're 100% sure it's the phone and not something else; we've tested the wifi out by connecting reconnecting devices, but as soon as it's connected to the phone, the router crashes. All other devices work just fine.

We thought it had to do with app updates being queued to download once on wifi, so we tried making sure to always download them before trying to connect to the home wifi, either over data or using the wifi at work, but even then it still occurs.

Has anyone else experienced this issue?

If it helps, out router model is DIR-1950. Maybe it's old and needs replacing? I'm not sure :(

If anyone here can help figure out what's going on I'd really appreciate it!

1iirtut,GooglePixel,My personal experience switching from Pixel 9 Pro XL to Oppo Find X8 Pro,"Finally, i found find x8 pro in white which has the extended warranty in my country. The switch was overwhelmed.

When it comes to photography, each device has its own advantages. Find x8 pro has better sensor and zoom, pixel 9 pro xl has better algorithm 

For the ergonomics... Pixel 9 pro xl takes the win. The power-volume button and fingerprint placement is way smarter than find x8 pro. With the find x8 pro I need to get used to it a little compared to the pixel.

1iiiz4s,GooglePixel,Pixel 8 Display Issues Are Becoming a Serious Concern,"Lately, I’ve been seeing daily posts from Pixel 8 users reporting display issues. This is really concerning because not everyone buys a new device expecting to send it to a service center for repairs shortly after purchase. When people invest in a phone, they expect reliable hardware, which is a major reason why many trust iPhones—not just for their build quality but also for the strong support they offer.

Honestly, I’ve never seen this many hardware complaints about an iPhone compared to what’s being reported for the Pixel 8. This should be a wake-up call for Google to take these issues seriously.

Some users are reporting display problems after just 3–4 months of use. I purchased my Pixel 8 around 3 months ago, and I’m genuinely worried I might be next. This is my only phone, and I rely on it for both personal and work purposes—I can’t afford to be without it even for a day because I don’t have a backup device.

What Google Should Do:
Offer additional warranty options like refunds or upgrades to the Pixel 9 or Pixel 8 Pro for the units that are under warranty. 

Google needs to address this issue proactively before more users are affected.

\- I find the interface bland as possible. is it possible to activate the acrylic effects on notifications and on the quick settings panel? it seems unthinkable to me not to have this option in 2025 on such powerful smartphones...



\- I heard about the AI ​​features via pixel editor but I don't have the application in question on my Pixel 9. Not found in the store either. where can I find it?



\- friends advised me to unlock the phone. What does it consist of? is it like jailbreaking on the iphone? is a stable and functional root available for the Pixel 9? what are the advantages and disadvantages?



\- last question, if unlocking is not possible or too complicated, do you know an application that allows us to modify the entire ui to our liking?

Earlier in the year I updated my pixel to android 15, sadly afterwards I noticed that the finger print sensor was failing (during most of the scans). I recall seeing a number of posts on this, with other experiencing similar issues. 

Eventually I sent the handset back to Google as it was unusable and they sent me a new one out with Android 14.

My questions is, have Google since fixed the issue with the fingerprinf sensor through another updated, or is it best to stay android 14 for now. 

I also have a pixel 8 pro and reluctant to update to Android 15 because of the same reason.

I take a lot of photos on my phone and process them using Lightroom. While the photos are noticeably sharper on the Pixel straight out of the camera, I’m running into issues when importing the RAW files into Lightroom.

The problem is that the RAW images from the Pixel appear noisy with faded textures, and they lose the sharpness I see in the original files. I’ve checked the color profiles during import (set to Google Pixel) and experimented with other profiles, but it hasn’t made a difference.

Interestingly, importing JPEGs from the Pixel into Lightroom works just fine—no issues with sharpness or texture. I never faced this problem with my iPhone, where I used Apple ProRAW, and the RAW workflow was smooth.

1ig55zw,GooglePixel,Do carrier variants allowed bootloader unlock for pixel 9 pro xl,"Hey everyone,

I recently purchased an ""unlocked"" Pixel 9 Pro XL from Backmarket with the intention of installing GrapheneOS. The phone is still in transit, so I haven't received it yet.

I usually use Samsung devices, so I'm not very familiar with Pixel firmware. My main concern is whether I might receive a network-unlocked carrier variant that doesn't allow bootloader unlocking.

Can anyone confirm if network-unlocked carrier variants allow bootloader unlocking? I’d really appreciate any insights.

From some brief searching in the subreddit, it looks like Verizon variants might be the biggest concern. At&t seem the least concerning. 


Update: I received the phone and it is unlocked. I was able to unlock the bootloader and install Graphene OS without any problems. 

I still have a remaining question though. Is there a way to distinguish between a network unlocked and factory unlocked pixel besides the unlock bootloader toggle?

Coming from Samsung all I had to do was look at the CSC's. For example: XAA/XAA/XAA/ATT means it was a network unlocked AT&T variant with the North America CSC's. ",2025-02-02 19:21:33,0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ig55zw/do_carrier_variants_allowed_bootloader_unlock_for/
1ig1x6j,GooglePixel,Frustrations with Pixel 9,"I have severe mixed feelings about my Pixel 9 that I have for a while now, and I love the feel of the UI and the camera, but everything else is just becoming increasingly frustrating. 

Firstly, is there a bug with notifications? For some reason my notifications from messaging apps like WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram and Messenger are either delayed or they don't ring at all. I'd looked up various solutions online and shut down the adaptive battery functions, double checked the apps notification but they still fail to notify me. I have another spare phone from Poco that gets my notifications almost immediately, and the performance of the Pixel is just embarrassing. What is going on with that? Are there any other solutions about it? 

Secondly, when I'm using WIFI to make video calls or play online games, there always seems to be an issue about connectivity and I'll lag seriously here and there, and my solution is just to switch off WIFI and just proceed with that. It usually solves the problem, but again why is it that other devices wouldn't have this problem? Let's not even go there about the Tensor chip because the performance is quite disappointing in gaming but thankfully I'm only a casual one and don't play demanding games.

Thirdly, with the Reddit app, there seems to be a bug where when I'm scrolled all the way to the top on a subreddit, I'm unable to click on the toolbar that's in the frame with the subreddit header above to search and I have to go back to the main page and search from there.

1ieoypl,GooglePixel,Long Post Ahead – My Honest and Complete Experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL as a Longtime iPhone User,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my full and honest experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).

# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XL

I usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn’t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max—at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.

# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The Camera

I’m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I’ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions—especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I’ve made a separate post about this issue).

# Software Experience: Just ""Good,"" But Not Exceptional

The Android experience on the Pixel is fine—it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.

Some features I really liked:

* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.
* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.
* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.

# Fingerprint and Face Unlock

* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.
* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don’t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.

# Camera: My Biggest Disappointment

Despite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.

# Issues I Faced:

1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** – Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.
2. **Depth of field issues** – The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can’t fully correct it.
3. **Limitations on third-party apps** – 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.
4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** – When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.
5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** – It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.
6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** – The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.
7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** – Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.

Most of these issues weren’t present on my iPhone, even though I’ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.

# App Store & Software Ecosystem

I also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent—many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.

# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily Use

I want to be clear: I’m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I’ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn’t lived up to my expectations.

I’m genuinely wondering:

* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?
* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?
* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?

I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I’d love to hear your thoughts and input—especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I’m overlooking?**



\*Edit 1 : More context 

I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the **Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding **RAW photo processing**.

I’ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in **Lightroom**—they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos. There’s a **huge loss of detail, aggressive noise reduction, and softening**, making the RAW files almost unusable for proper editing.

I’ve attached **two images of the same RAW file** to show what I mean:

📸 **Comparison Images**:  
[https://imgur.com/a/BdOOOty](https://imgur.com/a/BdOOOty)

1️⃣ **First image** → RAW viewed in Google Photos (looks relatively fine).  
2️⃣ **Second image** → The exact same RAW file opened in Lightroom (before any edits).

# The Issue:

* When opening the RAW file in **Lightroom**, it looks **significantly worse**, with **excessive smoothing and loss of sharpness**.
* This happens **before applying any adjustments**, so it’s not an issue with my editing.
* It feels like **Google is still applying some kind of processing or compression to RAW files**, which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW in the first place.

# Questions:

* **Is this a known issue with Pixel RAW processing?**
* **Is there a way to get true, unprocessed RAW files for editing?**
* **Anyone else experiencing this with Lightroom or other editing apps?**

I’d really appreciate any input from other Pixel users, especially photographers. I want to get the most out of this camera, but this has been a frustrating limitation. Let me know if you have any insights!

1id4wj2,GooglePixel,"Tried to switch from iPhone 16 Pro to Pixel 9 Pro, not successful","Hey,

As context, my first smartphone was an android, then switched to iphone 4 and went back to androids (oneplus and xiaomi) then switched to iphone 6 (before the 13 came out) and since the 13 mini I started using only iphones (upgrading every year, yes (never had to spend more money to upgrade)), now having the iPhone 16 Pro

Recently I've wanted to do more with my phone (particularly with automations) and was finding iOS to be limited (as I always knew). I was very sceptical but decided to just give it a shot for a week atleast.

Today I received it and went through the migration process etc, there were some quirks but to be expected, especially with Google Account and Gemini integration. Then i saw that when you **restart** the phone, you **lose all notifications**.... why? how is that something that happens with no way of fixing...

Still kept trying it until I went to play some audio on Spotify... and damn the audio is complete garbage for a high end phone... And I did try Youtube videos and just playing audio on the browser and the same experience happened. That was enough for me to decide to not switch over to the Pixel.  
Took me 3 hours... Im actually very disappointed never expected for the audio to be the deciding factor.

Even comparing with the Samsung you can see such a big difference in a Youtube video (imagine in person): [https://youtu.be/DnvbAAKlT3s?si=XcRs\_gcuN5AL2V38&t=540](https://youtu.be/DnvbAAKlT3s?si=XcRs_gcuN5AL2V38&t=540)

The issue is, I get text message alerts over and over and over again, from texts in the past. For example, I got a text last night at 9pm. Today on the drive into work, I got the alert for this text on my screen every 10 seconds the entire drive. If I hit ""read"", nothing happens (it usually reads the text message out loud). If I tap ""ignore"", the alert goes away and pops back up 10 seconds later. Over and over and over again. It's been this way for 3 days now. I've tried to unpair, reset phone, forget connection and retry it, etc.

What's also strange is when I receive the alert, it doesn't show the name of the contact, just the phone number, which is also strange behavior as the name of the contact is showing on the phone as well as on the car's phone book. Absolutely bizarre behavior.

Any suggestions?

1icplij,GooglePixel,Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Telephoto Lens Focusing Issue,"Does anybody experience the telephoto lens on the pixel 9 lineup having issues focusing on far subjects?, it's like the lens was not calibrated correctly and it is unable to focus far. On closer objects it is tack sharp, but on further objects it is like it's almost there, but the lens element just does not move enough.

I noticed the autofocus system struggling to compensate for this flaw as when I shoot manual focus, at no point during the slider, does the camera actually focuses on distant objects, but when I set the focus to Auto, the camera focuses beyond what I can achieve in manual mode but still not clear.

I've had Samsung's for years and decided to branch out to a Pixel 9 last week as the camera looks incredible for my Europe trip later this year. 

Everything about it is fine and mostly the same but the photos?! I had over 20! albums carefully curated over the years;
Holidays, pets ,daily life pictures, meme, selfies, spicy, screenshots of home Reno's, work projects, gym routines, meal preps etc. Just thousands of organized life that is now sorted by date only and an absolute shit show. I have no idea when I saved the 'high protein baked oats' recipe but I'm expected to know it was May 12th, 2019 and scroooooooooolllll back? 

I'm so lost and frustrated this thing cost me like $1600 and it made things impossible for daily life.
I'm walking around with my old Samsung 21 Ultra still for the albums. Can anyone give me a simpleton, child like explanation to help me curate albums again or a YouTube video that doesn't take an 10 min intro of talking sh*t that my ADHD has me zoned out of immediately because they talk too fkn slow

That being said, I’m still on the fence about the change, in particular I’d like to know how 9 Pro XL behaves regarding:

1) **battery life**: I bought the 16 Pro Max because I’ve read that battery life was incredible, but I don’t find that to be the case

1ibyasx,GooglePixel,Google assistant gone completely? Gemini won't open and accept commands.,"I’ve been a dedicated Pixel user since the Pixel 3, and one of the key reasons I stuck with this ecosystem was the strong integration of Google Assistant. Unfortunately, my experience with the recent transition to Gemini has been frustrating and disappointing.

For the past few days, it feels like Google Assistant has been wiped entirely from my phone. When I use ""Hey Google,"" nothing happens except a small green mic icon in the top right corner that indicates something is listening. There’s no beep, no on-screen visuals, and, ultimately, no functionality. It seems like Gemini has taken over, and frankly, it’s failing to provide even the most basic usability I relied on.

The Gemini app no longer has an option to switch back to Google Assistant, which makes me think Assistant has been dropped entirely. If that’s the case, it’s frustrating to see such a core feature—one that made Pixel phones stand out—being phased out or replaced with something that feels incomplete.

I recently purchased a Pixel 9 Pro, but I’m seriously considering abandoning it entirely and moving over to Apple to see if the grass is greener. Beyond these issues, being a Google Workspace user makes everything even more complicated: many features are blocked or delayed, adding to my frustration.

It feels like Google is dismantling the very things that once made it great, and as a long-time Pixel fan, it’s disheartening.

Am I doing something wrong? Is there a button I have to press. Let me know please.",2025-01-28 10:04:46,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ibyasx/google_assistant_gone_completely_gemini_wont_open/

1ibilro,GooglePixel,Sounds cuts out during quiet moments,"Looking to see if other users have experienced this issue. 

I have a Pixel Tablet and Pixel 9 Pro XL

While watching videos the sound will briefly cut out if there isn't any talking or background sound during quiet moments in shows / movies. The sound will immediately come back on when speech etc resumes but sometimes there can be a brief pause and it will miss the first second of dialogue.

I have searched and tried everything but can't find a fix. It's not a hardware or headphone issue. It feels like a setting but I can't find any answers or solutions. 

I have even tried factory resets but the issue still persists. 

Below are suggestions Google recommended. Curious if anyone has experienced this issue and if so if you have found fix. 

If your Google Pixel's sound cuts out when it's quiet, you can try these steps:
Check the battery: Make sure your Pixel Buds and charging case are charged. 
Check Bluetooth: Confirm that Bluetooth is on and that your Pixel Buds are paired with your device. 
Check the connection: Make sure your Pixel Buds are within range of your device. 
Restart your device: Restarting your phone can fix software-related issues. 
Check for updates: Install the latest software updates for your phone and Pixel Buds. 
Check your settings: Make sure your audio isn't muted, lowered, or misrouted. 
Clean your device: Gently clean your phone's speakers and microphones with a soft, lint-free cloth. 
Check your accessories: Remove any screen protectors or cases, and try using a different audio accessory. 
Reset your network settings: Resetting your network settings can fix connection issues. 
Try safe mode: Put your phone in safe mode to see if a third-party app is causing the issue. 
Factory reset: If basic troubleshooting doesn't work, you can try resetting your phone to factory settings. ",2025-01-27 20:05:21,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ibilro/sounds_cuts_out_during_quiet_moments/

Has anyone observed this difference of out of focus zoom for Pixel 9 pro and Pixel 9 pro xl while recording the video from rear camera.

1iavfvd,GooglePixel,Pixel 9 series AI goodies on other languages,"Hello everyone!

Just ordered my Pixel 9 Pro XL and a loooong wait is expected :D

Until I get it, I'm wondering about usage of some of the new AI features (which sadly never made it to my 7 Pro). Mostly interested on Weather and Screenshots apps, but the rest would also be nice if they worked as I hope.

I have a pet peeve of having my phone's language to my main language (Greek).

As far as I have read around, most (if not all) of the new AI apps (like Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Studio) or apps which include new AI features (like Weather and Photos) only work in English and need to be sideloaded in the EU. I have no issues with sideloading from APKmirror, but an anyone let us know if the language barrier applies to the phone's system language, or the app language (like if set through per-app language settings)?

Essentially, would I be able to set -only- those apps to be in English from the per-app language from settings? Or does the whole device need to be set to English?

Thank you! :)

Okay, I've had my Pixel 9 Pro for a couple of months now, and overall, I'm loving it. But can we talk about Google Wallet for a minute?
Way too often, I'll tap my phone on the terminal and...nothing.  Just sits there like a brick. This even happens when the phone is unlocked, which is supposed to work seamlessly.  It works maybe 85% of the time, but that other 15% is enough to make me carry my physical cards everywhere.
And then there's this weird ""multiple cards detected"" error I keep getting at certain stores.  I only have one card set as default, so I have no clue what's going on there.
Finally, why is Google Pay integration so spotty on websites and apps?  Apple Pay seems to be accepted everywhere, but I'm constantly having to pull out my physical card for online purchases.

1ia6y0d,GooglePixel,Disappearing mobile data connection Pixel 9 Pro XL (Japan),"Hi,

recently purchased a Japanese Pixel 9 Pro XL and everything is working fine except occasionally disappearing mobile data connection.

When it happens, I see only the exclamation mark in the signal strength indicator (image in the link [https://imgur.com/1epV4Z1](https://imgur.com/1epV4Z1) ). Wifi connection is always fine, even during those episodes.

It doesn't fix by itself. Sometime it is enough to open the Internet tab from the pull-down menu and press on the mobile connection to fix it, but in most cases I need to reset the mobile settings (reset button with a wrench at the top right corner of the internet menu). After couple of presses/resets it is usually fixed. 

I couldn't notice any pattern for what triggers it so far. Usually (but not always) when I check the phone in the morning it's gone. Sometimes it happens during the day too, but I couldn't yet figure out for what reason.

It is a Japanese version and I am using a Japanese data-only physical sim card. I tested it on a different voice+data sim card and it happens as well.

1i9x8s4,GooglePixel,Pixel issues as a new user,"
I've had my Pixel 9 for five days now, after being a Samsung galaxy series user for 10 years, and I'm really frustrated with several issues. First, I can't select multiple photos at once in the gallery by swiping my finger, which is a major inconvenience. Also, the microphone is inconsistent – sometimes it picks up my voice and other times it doesn't. Then there's the Assistant – it always searches for 'Jimmy Night' or opens the Gemini website when I want to use Gemini. Finally, my screen keeps locking while I'm using Gemini, especially when the screen timeout kicks in. It's really disruptive. I'm wondering if other users are having similar problems.

Sometimes I get lucky in a browser, but it's something that I simply can't rely on anymore. Hell, I just tried it in Settings and it can't read the guide for StoS. 

I don't know what changed, but whatever it is it broke the tool almost everywhere. I have other reading apps, so if I want to read an article I can send text over there... But the convenience of Select to Speak is something I miss.

1i7hgbd,Android,"Google rolls out new accessibility features for Android, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25","Alongside updates to [Gemini](https://www.androidfaithful.com/gemini-at-galaxy-unpacked-25/) and [Circle to Search](https://www.androidfaithful.com/circle-to-search-at-galaxy-unpacked-25/), Google also unveiled new accessibility features coming to select Android devices, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25 series.

## Hearing aid support over Bluetooth LE Audio

For starters, Google says that it's launching LE Audio compatibility on the Galaxy S25, enabling hands-free calling and a low-latency connection to [GN ReSound](https://www.resound.com/en-us/) and [Oticon Intent](https://www.oticon.com/) hearing aids. Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. 

For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.

While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.

Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. 

## Support for braille displays that use HID

For people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.

In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices.",2025-01-22 18:04:19,49,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1i7hgbd/google_rolls_out_new_accessibility_features_for/
1i7hg55,Android,"Gemini is getting smarter with apps, YouTube videos, and your camera","Samsung is one of the best-selling Android smartphone brands, so it's no surprise that Google works closely with them. During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.

## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos

[Gemini Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I/O 2024.

Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.

These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.

Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.

## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app

[Project Astra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.

Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.

## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and services

Although Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.

Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.

Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.

## New Gemini extensions for Samsung apps

Google also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder. These four apps are exclusive to Samsung devices, and their extensions enable the following actions to be taken:

*   **Samsung Calendar**
    *   Create, edit, and delete events on your calendar
    *   Capture info from images to create events
    *   List events for a date range and create repeating events
*   **Samsung Clock**
    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show alarms
    *   Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch
    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show timers
*   **Samsung Notes**
    *   Create and summarize notes
    *   Retrieve your notes based on descriptions and titles
*   **Samsung Reminder**
    *   Create reminders for a specific time or date
    *   Edit a reminder’s name, time or date
    *   Search for reminders by name, time or date
    *   Delete reminders",2025-01-22 18:04:06,56,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1i7hg55/gemini_is_getting_smarter_with_apps_youtube/

The thing is that it doesn't always work, especially if I'm trying to take a snapshot somewhere in the middle or if there's a video involved.

1hpc3s7,Android,Pixel vs Samsung (OneUI) features - Trying to make a list,"I'm trying to make a list of what you gain or lose in Samsung's environment versus Google's. 

This is a list of features I could think of that are on one platform, but not the other. 

Samsung Exclusives:

* **Dex** Desktop Android - ~~Going away in OneUI 7~~ The desktop app is going away, Dex is staying.
* ~~**SD Cards**~~ - None of their new phones, after the S20, have SD card slots
* **Split audio** - You can pipe one app through one output and another app through another output (e.g. Chrome goes through the phone's speakers and YouTube goes through Bluetooth) 
* **Game mode** - Little features that make gaming easier, like locking the screen from touches, performance mode, hiding notifications, etc... 
* **Being able to map double clicking the power button to the flashlight instead of the camera** - This one ANNOYS THE SHIT OUT OF ME on Pixel. Moto let's you karate chop, Samsung let's you remap the power button, Pixel tells you to go fuck yourself even though there are literally hundreds and hundreds of complaints about this on their support forums and reddit. 
* **All of the Samsung ecosystem** - Bixby, Samsung Wallet, Samsung Find My Device, Galaxy App Store, etc... Not that anyone actually uses any of this. 
* **Miracast** - You can mirror your screen wirelessly to Roku sticks or any TV (most TVs) that support Miracast.
* **Reset phone after 15 unlock attempts** - For some reason even though Apple and Samsung offer this feature, Pixel doesn't. 
* **Repeat notifications** - If you get a text or something you can make the phone ding multiple times instead of once (this is possible on Pixel with the Buzzkill app) 

Google Exclusives: 

~~* **Call screening** - Unknown callers or people you don't want to talk to talk to Google and you see a text transcription on your phone~~ Bixby Text Call does this 
 
* **Text transcriptions of voicemails** - Visual Voicemail without have to pay for it from the carrier (or use Google Voice)
* **Wait on hold for me / Text navigation of IVRs** - Google goes through IVRs and alerts you when a human comes on the line
* **Call summaries** - After years of actively blocking call recording (at least in the US) they now let Gemini Nano listen to your calls and make a call summary afterwards (at least on Pixel 9 and above - not on 8a) 
* **Seamless updates** - Updates install in the background, you reboot your phone, it's installed. Doesn't take 10+ minutes of installing 

They both have a bunch of AI camera stuff. Mainly the same functionality. 

It really seems like the unique features are the least unique they've ever been. Things like one hand mode, lock down, work profile, etc... that used to be OneUI exclusives were just absorbed by AOSP/Pixel. 

I'm sure I'm missing many things - Can you help me fill out the list?",2024-12-30 01:56:39,22,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1hpc3s7/pixel_vs_samsung_oneui_features_trying_to_make_a/
1hip15a,Android,"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.

I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:

1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the ""on-ice"" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).
2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.
3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.

Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all.

1iiljxr,Smartphones,Recieved my 16 pro max and Google Pixel 9 pro.. hard to pick.,"Recieved both. It's hard to decide which to actually keep.

The 16 pro max is 500 euro more than the pixel both feel really nice in the hand.. (well more like 400 but I'm waiting for the 80 eur discount after purchase to be sent)

I've been enjoying both, I believe the 16pm battery seems to last a good bit longer in comparison to the pixel and the amount of preset filters etc feels really nice and the better chip making the phone better in the long term? The 16pm has 256gb storage while the p9pxl has 128gb since it was the only one around this price, both are fine since 128gb+google drive is okay. Even though the pixel has a weaker chip it still feels extremely snappy and I've not ran into any overheating issues people talked about even gaming in cod mobile or NFS had no issues or it wasnt laggy.

Build quality they both feel really nice in the hand. I know the pixel is aluminium and the iPhone is titanium.

Software wise at first I wasnt liking iOS, I thought it was weird icons looked weird but after using it I do not mind it as much as I thought I would. I heard there will be iOS19 or something that should make promising updates in the future but very unsure. Pixel.. android is android I'm coming from a pixel 7 pro, mainly upgrading over the screen the new screens on these 2 phones are so much better and battery effiency.

Camera wise I believe they're very similar but different, The selfie camera on the iPhone seems way better and it captures details up close like if I was to take a picture of my eye on the iphone it'd be ultra clear while the pixel would be very blurry. The pixel tends to take photos with more accurate colors and it picks up more details like even a glass panel with dirt on it is censored out by the iPhone for no reason? It also seems the iPhone over sharpens certain details to make it more HD. While other times the Pixel adds random white glows around example a pigeon, here for example: [https://imgur.com/a/iphone-16-pro-max-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-G7oPCc7](https://imgur.com/a/iphone-16-pro-max-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-G7oPCc7)

It's really hard to pick both phones are amazing. They both feel and look great, the pictures are nice on both but have a very different aesthetic some settings like exposure missing on the pixel is one but not a big thing. OS wise neither is a deal breaker to me, Maybe notifcations on iOS are a little annoying or different but it's a different OS soo..

I was contemplating the S25 ultra also as a middle ground since thats what people say but I've heard theyre using an older M13+ screen and it's somewhat darker and the whites are more blue-ish than the 16pm and p9pxl and using a screen protector removes the anti reflection? It's possible to get s25 ultra + galaxy 7 watch for 980, but I heard lots of bad things about one ui and galaxy phones getting green lines down the screen so on.

1iig4ro,Smartphones,Should I Upgrade to the Vivo X200 Pro Now or Wait for Future Releases? (Camera Dilemma),"Hey everyone! I’m currently using a OnePlus 12 and have been pretty happy with it, but I’ve been eyeing the Vivo X200 Pro lately. From my personal testing, the camera quality (especially in low light and portrait mode) seems roughly 30% better to my eyes. The dynamic range and detail are noticeably sharper, which is tempting as a photography enthusiast.  

The catch: I can afford to switch right now, but I’m torn. With new flagships like the Pixel 9 series, iPhone 16 lineup, and next-gen Vivo/OPPO devices rumored to drop in the next 6-8 months, I’m wondering:  

1. Is the Vivo X200 Pro’s camera leap worth upgrading immediately, or should I hold out for potentially bigger improvements later?  
2. Anyone here made the jump from OnePlus to Vivo? How’s the long-term experience?  
3. Are there any leaks/rumors about significant camera upgrades in late 2024/early 2025 phones that might overshadow the X200 Pro?  

I know tech always gets better, but that 30% difference is gnawing at me. Would love your thoughts—am I overthinking this, or is patience the play?

1ii8lpd,Smartphones,Samsung Galaxy S24/25 or iPhone 16 Plus,"I have posted before but I am now torn between 2 phones for my next upgrade. I currently own the Honor Magic 6 Lite which I don't dislike at all, but there are some connectivity issues and issues with the camera. 

I have ruled out the Pixel 9 after reading so many bad things about it I am not willing to take the risk. I am reconsidering Samsung as an option. 

I have owned 3 iPhones the iPhone 4 which I had for just over a year before Apple released an update which broke the phone and it couldn't be fixed. The iPhone 8 was the best phone I have ever owned and lasted 6 years before I needed to replace it and the iPhone 12 was a terrible phone riddled with issues. 

I have owned 4 Samsungs over the last 10 years 2 from the S range and 2 from the A range. All of them had issues with longevity, battery degradation, software issues, connectivity issues, lag, freezing alot and they all needed replacing within the 2 year time frame. I use my phone for the most basic of tasks. It has put me off Samsung, yet I know many people who have had Samsung phones for years and they are still going strong. Maybe I have been unlucky. 

I do want a flagship phone but after spending all of that money I want to get 4-6 years out of it, if not more. In terms of software I do not have a preference. I like both Android and iOS equally and the lack of customisation on iOS doesn't bother me. 

I own a mix of devices:-
iPad & Samsung tablet (iPad is 7/8 years old and still works). 
iPod and Airpods
Macbook. 
Honor Buds. 
Huawei WatchFit3. 

I have read about issues with both the phones I'm torn between. I am wondering what people would pick between the 2 and why? 

Please don't mention other brands & models. I have narrowed it down to these 2 after reading so many good things about Samsung compared to Pixel Samsung is now an option I am considering again.

1iho1w4,Smartphones,16 pro max vs Pixel 9 PXL vs S24 Ultra - Which to pick?,"So currently II am trying to find a new phone, I already have the 16 pro max and the Pixel 9 pro xl and I have been comparing them, theyre really close but after the cool factor of never experiencing iOS I feel like the phone feels limited in what you can do, the pixel can do way more and it's like 400 less give or take.

Between these 2 I think the 16 pro max takes better photos they have more detail especially when you zoom in but the pixel outside tends to have nicer colors. For selfies the pixel tends to add an invisible filter making my skin really pink or red and make them bright when it's not bright at all, or taking pictures of birds in the sky they have white outlines while the iphone doesnt. Makes it harder. OS wise android feels way snappier iOS feels a bit slow and clunky compared to pixel oh and so much animations, disabling helped a lil bit.

1ihhjt9,Smartphones,"iPhone 16 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro, or Galaxy S25? Reposting Now That the S25 Is Out","Hey everyone, sorry for the repost, but now that the Galaxy S25 is officially out, I wanted to reconsider my options with fresh eyes.

I’m currently debating between:

iPhone 16 Pro – Premium design, fluid ecosystem, long software support, but super expensive, and Apple Intelligence isn’t even available in Europe yet. iOS 18 looks solid, but I’d lose Android’s flexibility. Also, I’ve heard typing on iOS can be kind of annoying, which makes me hesitant since I type a lot.

Pixel 9 Pro – Great camera and battery, but stock Android is just not it for me. I can’t handle Android stock as is—it’s too barebones and honestly kind of ugly. I’d 100% have to put Nova Launcher or something similar to make it feel decent.

Galaxy S25 – Best price-to-value ratio, One UI is polished, and Gemini AI is integrated. Samsung is also offering double storage + earbuds for HALF the price of the iPhone if I preorder. My only hesitation is the design—I'm not a fan of the three vertically aligned cameras. (Should I wait for the S25 Edge ?)


Right now, I’m using a Galaxy S9 from 2018, and it's finally starting to give up on me. So whatever I pick, I need it to last at least another 5+ years.

I have no real preference—I just don’t want to regret staying with Samsung or switching to something new. The Pixel is tempting for the camera and battery, the iPhone 16 Pro looks and feels premium, and the S25 is just an insane deal right now.

Hoping someone can help me decide before tomorrow, because Samsung’s preorder offer ends in 48 hours, hahaha. (Not saying I’m leaning toward it, but, well, you know how it is...)

1ido7sd,Smartphones,2025 smartphone advice - Samsung S25+ vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro vs. OnePlus 13,"Currently owning a OnePlus 5T in the UAE.

Have been looking at all the above phones online for the past month and am eternally confused. They all have different specs at different price points.

I can usually hold a phone for a good period of time. My current device was purchased back in 2017 and the only reason I have to change now is due to my failing battery. The OnePlus 5T is truly an amazing device, with the best thing being that placement of the biometric finger reader (at the phone's rear - I wonder why no other phone has replicated this!)

Coming back to topic, here are my observations for all 3 devices -  
Google Pixel 9 Pro - I've heard excellent reviews of this phone, but the fact that it's Google's makes me want to reconsider it  
OnePlus 13 - It isn't officially available in the UAE so there's no way for me to check it out before buying. Being an existing OnePlus user, I do trust their OS and hardware. Also, the fast charging and 6000 mah battery is unparalleled. Only lacking issue I've ever had with the OnePlus is their camera.  
Samsung S25+ - AI is advertised as excellent, but not sure if it's pragmatic. It's the most expensive of the lot. But I've heard the experience is one of the best among Android.

Please can someone with relevant experience/expertise guide.

**Edit/Update 08 Feb '25**:   
I have narrowed down my choices; but face the below dilemma now -  
OnePlus13 - I have decided to go for this. But since they're not officially selling in the UAE, I have been advised to refrain from getting the international versions since repairs will not be covered due to a lack of authorised service centres in the UAE.

Samsung S25+ - They have authorised sellers and repair centres in the UAE, but I don't really want to go for it.

Of course i want to keep all the Devices but the phone

Apple is no option, e.g. cuz of the Android Devices i love above.

So im kinda between the s25u which Yin und yangs between great 7 years of Support but also no Relevant new Features, so im having a hard time Pressing the buy Button for the approx 1200 euros tho it has the monthly option to pay for 0% price increase on the homepage.

Xiaomi 14t pro sounds very nice for its price, but there im not familiar with hyperos, and im not Sure if i might regret switching to a copy of Android which might stumble into Problems (copy not in a bad way tho..)

Pixel 9 pro xl has a very nice design and is a bit more attractive in terms of costs, so also in the top 3.

Im open to New Inputs and ideas,  experiences and so on.

Budget: around 1000€ as a point of orientation
Good camera would be great and keeping it for years is the goal.. Well i think all the phones in that price range has good battery life and camera so im having a hard time to name Priorities, lemme just hear your ideas.

1ic9f5o,Smartphones,Considering the switch from iPhone 16 Pro Max to Pixel 9 Pro XL,"Hi folks,

I’ve always been an iPhone user until XR, then I tried Android and lately I’ve returned to iPhone because I thought, and I still think, that third-party apps are simply more polished and optimized, but there are many things (regarding software) that I find better on Android. In addition, I don’t like iOS 18 at all since I had some issues. 

N.B. I’m not into mobile gaming and at the moment I don’t have other Apple devices. 

Therefore I’m considering to switch to Pixel Pro 9 XL. Did anybody do the same change?

If yes, I’d like to know how 9 Pro XL behaves regarding:

1) **battery life**: I bought the 16 Pro Max because I’ve read that battery life was incredible, but I don’t find that to be the case

2) **photos** I’m an amateur photographer and I like especially to take pictures of landscapes. I’m wondering also how 9 Pro XL scores regarding night/low light photos

3) does using the Pixel during the night cause eyestrain?

Thanks a lot!",2025-01-28 19:08:11,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1ic9f5o/considering_the_switch_from_iphone_16_pro_max_to/

As the title suggests, I need help deciding which phone I should get.  
*I'm (finally) upgrading from my old pal Oneplus 6.*   
  
I don't care much about AI stuff, cameras, wireless charging. I want something that is well built, has a clean OS, will last me a few years with updates and it is fast with good battery time. I guess both fit in these requirements. I live in Europe so the S24 comes with Exynos processor. 
I prefer these 2 (base) models because of the ""smaller"" size.

Right now, I can buy the **S24** for **578,90 €** and the **Pixel 9** for **694,49 €**.

Looking for alternative phones that perform almost as good as the Galaxy S24 Ultra 512gb, for a lot less of its retail price ($1500). Currently leaning on older flagships but will consider latest flagships if the price can be justified. I just want a phone that's practical and isn't a marketing gimmick tragedy.

My main considerations are the:

* Xiaomi 14T Pro 512gb | $700 
* Vivo x100 Pro 256gb | $660
* Google Pixel 9 Pro 256gb+ | $800-$1000
* Sony Xperia

# Criteria

After having the Galaxy S24 Ultra, my first flagship phone, for almost a whole year, I've learned a lot on what I want in a phone. I'm currently looking into a new one, and your insights and advice would be appreciated! Thanks!

I've done some research and used [GSMArena's Phone Finder tool](https://www.gsmarena.com/search.php3). I've got some options now, and I guess this post is about whether it's worth it or not. Also, I suck at researching and have trust issues with reviews, especially on YouTube, so here I am.

Here's my current criteria for a phone:

* **Price to value ratio & hardware longevity**
   * Learned the hard way that getting the latest flagships from Samsung/Apple at full price typically isn't worth it. 
   * I just want it to last me as long as it could and won't start to lag in just a few years.
   * Budget range would be around $600-$900 max, but if the price beyond could be justified, I'll consider it. 
   * *^(For reference, I got the S24 Ultra 512GB for $1500 last year with pre-order benefits, and I regret it big time.)* 
   * ^(Will consider second-hand/refurbished/renewed devices with warranty & 30 days return.)
* **Heat and Battery efficiency**
   * Battery life per charge that can last for at least 7 hours of screen-on time consistently.  *^(or just a whole day without having to charge on afternoon honestly)*
   * I don't want a phone that's being marketed with having a ""super powerful chip"" and ""super bright screen"" but in reality, heats up quick and throttles performance in just a few minutes of use when outdoors.
   * I play some games in high graphics & framerate, but I value stability and efficiency over performance. (At least 90fps)
* **Camera**
   * Has at least 24MP+, 55mm telephoto lens.
   * Able to record 4K 60fps on telephoto lens.
   * Good telephoto performance on mid-low light.
   * *Bigger sensor over phone aesthetics??*
   * *^((perhaps a camera that's also battery & heat efficient?))*
* **Storage**
   * At least 256 / 512gb, unless there are factors that can justify only 128GB.
   * I take a lot of pictures and videos when going outside. 
   * Also keep a lot of files on my phone. 
   * SD Card slot would be nice but not necessary.
* Others
   * Less marketing gimmicks, more practical features. 
      * I don't need super high megapixels, super high refresh rates, ""AI"" sh\*t.
   * Good aftersales is a myth in my country but let me know if there's a brand that has a good customer service reputation worldwide.

I realize this may be a lot of text, and tbh I just really want a phone that's ""worth it"".

# Other options:

* Google Pixel
   * *^(So far, I've been hearing good news about the latest Pixel 9. I'm also considering the older models, but I've heard something about their chips being inefficient or stuff.)*
   * *^(Might have issues with warranty and returns since I'll be bringing it to a country where it's not supported.)*
      * Pixel 9 Pro 256gb refurbished ($799 on Amazon US) (carrier unlocked)
      * Pixel 7 Pro 128gb ($430 on my local store)
* Vivo
   * *^(I've been seeing the x200 Pro being recommended by plenty of people online, but I'm not so sure.)* 
      * x200 Pro 512gb ($1200, will wait for when it drops)
      * x100 Pro (around $660)
      * other older models
* Xiaomi
   * I've been seeing the name a lot and on YouTube comparison videos. 
      * 14 Ultra
      * 14T Pro 512gb ($700 on official website)",2025-01-21 06:06:19,1,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1i6c5q7/help_me_pick_cheaper_alternatives_for_the_galaxy/

While I was initially blown away by the camera on the 7a, over the years the terrible battery life(worse than the s20 it replaced) and constant severe heating has led me to to want out of this phone, and Googles tensor chips in general.

All of these are carrier options:

- S22 ultra CPO, $21/mo

- S23 ultra CPO, $28/mo( out of stock, but pops up once or twice a month)

- S23 ultra new, $33/mo with $800 down

- S24 new, $15/mo

- Pixel 9 pro new, $33/mo with $400 down

- Pixel 9 new, $24/mo

- Galaxy Z Flip6 new, $25/mo

  
How does one compare a phone that's a few years old to a newer one camera wise? The s24 is the logical choice here, but I REALLY do not want a downgrade in camera quality. Suggestions or advice welcome. Prefer a pick from the listed phones, or experience moving from Pixel camera to Samsung. Thank you!

1i0db6o,Smartphones,What next after a Galaxy S20 FE? ,"Hi everyone, I hope you're all doing well.

Currently, I'm using a Samsung S20 FE, which I bought as soon as it was released, so it's been with me for quite some time. Since I don’t see the need to change phones every year, I’ve stuck with it. But now, I need a new one. Let me say this: I haven’t enjoyed a phone this much since my Nexus 7 — kudos to Samsung for that!

Here are my reasons for needing a new phone now:

* The battery isn’t what it used to be.
* The phone has become painfully slow, probably due to software trying to conserve the aging battery.
* It stopped receiving major updates after Android 13. Now that I need to use passkeys, which require at least Android 14, it's becoming a problem.
* The backplate keeps falling off because the glue has lost its hold. 😅
* When using GPS apps, it points slightly off, which is frustrating - probably an issue with the compass.
* The phone overheats a lot—likely another reason the glue is no longer effective.

So, here’s the challenge. Right now, my options are:

* **Google Pixel 9 Pro XL**: Looks amazing, and it’d be nice to have access to features like ONE UI 7.
* **Samsung S24+**: A cheaper option, but I’m in Portugal, so no Snapdragon version for us.
* **Galaxy Event**: It’s just around the corner, but I need a phone *now*—remember the backplate situation.

Can anyone help me make a better decision? I hate buying new stuff because I end up overthinking it, which makes me anxious. 😅",2025-01-13 12:55:55,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1i0db6o/what_next_after_a_galaxy_s20_fe/

I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, which I really liked, but unfortunately, I dropped it in water, and it got damaged. So now I’m considering my options for a new phone. I’ve been happy with the Samsung experience, but I’m also thinking about trying a Google Pixel to experience the pure Android interface and the advantages of its camera.

I don’t play games on my phone, so the processor isn’t a huge concern for me. From what I understand, the Samsung S24 is generally considered better overall (except for the camera, where the Pixel shines), but I’m not really sure in which aspects this shows in practice.

One thing I’ve never used on my S20 FE is Dex mode, and I don’t fully understand the benefit of using it that way. It seems easier to just use my computer when I need something with a bigger screen or more productivity-based.

What to do? I am really really undecided right now.",2025-01-10 18:58:01,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1hybwlr/pixel_9_pro_ipad_mini_or_samsung_s25_ultra_help/

1hwd0v3,Smartphones,"Pixel 9, Galaxy S23 FE, or iPhone 13","Those are the three phones offered by my job. I have a personal iPhone 13 Pro. 

I don't really have any specific needs. It'll be a three year contract so I can ask for another phone in three years. 

I'm leaning Pixel to see what it's like. And the many years of updates. An Android would be interesting to get to learn. The iPhone 13 would be familiar, the base model version of my personal phone, so it would be the lazy/easy choice. But feels crazy to get a 3.5 year old phone vs a half year old phone. 

Any thoughts?",2025-01-08 06:02:01,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1hwd0v3/pixel_9_galaxy_s23_fe_or_iphone_13/
1hvzjnr,Smartphones,Pixel 9 Pro 256GB or OP13 512GB,"Hello Guys,
which one would you choose?
Both would cost 949€. I'm using oneplus Smartphones since 2016, but I'm not sure If it's really an Upgrade. Software Support from tue Pixel would be far longer.

What do you think?

Hey Reddit,

After being a loyal iOS user for 13 years, I’m finally considering switching back to Android. It’s been a long time since I used Android, so I’m not sure what to expect in terms of performance, user experience, and longevity.

Currently, I’m torn between the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and the OnePlus 13. My top priorities are:
- Battery life: I need a phone that can last a full day of heavy use without constant recharging.
- Performance over time: One thing I appreciated about iOS was the consistency. My concern is whether Android phones still have the issue of slowing down after a year or two. Are these two models good at maintaining performance?
Does one stand out in terms of build quality or performance (daily use only no gaming, rendering etc.). Or is still best sticking to apple and choosing 16 pro over this two?",2025-01-04 23:46:03,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1htryjo/new_smartphone/

1hspuzr,Smartphones,Pixel 9 Pro in EU - worth the € ?,"Hi everyone, this is a question aimed at people in the EU, as from reading people's opinions in this and other subs, the US is a total different world for deals on phones in general.

At the moment, the country where I live has an offer for a free Fitbit Versa 4 if I purchase a Pixel 9 Pro. I am contemplating buying the 256GB one, and I am able to use a gift voucher, which will bring the price down to 800€ total. Does this seem a good opportunity in EU standards? I reckon we should not expect any major price drops in the coming months and I really need to change my phone as I'm currently using a very old Samsung A50 which is end of life. Personally, I want a phone smaller than 6.4' with a robust camera and there aren't many options out there other than P9P.

Thanks in advance!",2025-01-03 16:07:10,4,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1hspuzr/pixel_9_pro_in_eu_worth_the/
