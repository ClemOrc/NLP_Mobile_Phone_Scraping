GooglePixel,Continued conversation with Google Assistant not working,"Hi, I'm using Pixel 9 Pro and my problem is that whenever I use Google Assistant and ask him to do anything, if I want to have a conversation or clarify anything I told him, I have to say ""hey google"" again even though in options, I have continued conversation enabled. I'm using both English UK and my native language on the assistant and the microphone turns off after my first prompt regardless of the language I use.

Any fix?

GooglePixel,Pixel 9 Pro horizontal green line after screen times out should I be worried?,"A green line shows up close to the bottom of the screen when the display times out. This only really happens to me when the phone is at a low brightness level otherwise it's working flawlessly, also it happens about 10% of the time I've been using it at low brightness levels. Should I be worried about this? On another note, I also have a bit of dust underneath my main and telephoto lens, but I'm not too worried about this since I can only see it under direct sunlight.

GooglePixel,Help with Google Photos,"Helping my 75 years old father-in-law as he was sold a more complicated phone than he needed. He has the Pixel 9 Pro now and only want to open the Google Photos to show ALL photos instead of having to click a few places to get to photos instead messages, etc. 

The closest I got was the “On Device” section in category but how do I make that to be the default location when he open the App?!

Thank you in advance! 

Comments:
I am not sure whether this is what you want but try it, 
On the photos section( one that you see when you open up the app) click the three dots on the right side of the day and disable the toggle that says 'only show backed up content' this should almost just show all the photos like a clutter, which might be why it's turned off by default.
Tell me if its what you need.
You can use google gallery app instead of using google photos
load the goigle Gallery app from the play store. It is a simple version of the photo app and is probably what you're looking for.",2025-02-08 16:25:56,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ikr1yi/help_with_google_photos/
GooglePixel,My thoughts on the Pixel 9 Pro XL,"Warning: negative experience ahead. Fanboys beware.

The Pixel 9 Pro XL is my first pixel device. I was always fascinated by Pixels since the first release, but I never got one since it's not officially sold in my region.
When the Pixel 9 came out and the reviews said it was finally able to compete with other flagships I was excited.
I finally got my hands on one and I've been using it exclusively since october. Everything was perfect at the start. The phone felt premium. The fingerprint sensor worked as well as my Samsung's. The UI was buttery with the smoothest animations I've ever seen on a phone. It was everything I wanted from a phone.

But as time went on I started to notice annoyances that have cumulatively turned me off for good. Mostly software issues that kept getting worse and/or  never fixed through updates.

- Let's start with a simple one. My pixel was improted from Japan. The camera sounds cannot be turned off due to regulations there. Other phones will enable the option if you have an international SIM card. My SIM is not japanese and my google account is not associated with japan in any way so why is the option still disabled.

- Gemini advanced free 1 year trial failed to activate on my account, and I tried 2 other accounts to no avail.

- The phone can't handle rotations with gesture controls. Many many times when I switch to portrait from landscape the gesture bar will stay at the side until I swipe home from the side, then the screen will flash and get fixed.

- Sometimes when I copy my credit card number it only pastes the last 4 digits? very bizzare and sounds like an app specific issue but my Samsung never did this.

- The camera is far worse than I expected. I used a Samsung Galaxy S23U with GCAM mod and it was easily better. I just hated that it was slow and I had to switch to the default app for video and other modes.

- The camera processing is very bad in certain situations. Like zoom, night mode, and worst of all, night mode zoom shots. The photo comes out looking incredible for half a second before the final processed image is shown. Look up a video titled ""GCam v9.6 Destroyed My Pixel Camera"" by @IDTR on youtube. I'm not the only one who noticed.

- I was filming a concert the other day and in one video the camera froze for 5 seconds when I switched lenses, the outright crashed when i switched again. Very frustrating.
- Telephoto RAW files are very soft with bloom effect, I thought my lense was smudged in the beginning. JPEGs looks fine but RAWs are affected and it's very difficult to fix in Lightroom.

- Video stabilization is very jumpy. It will stabilize well and stay in one place while panning then suddenly jump to the side. Very strange behavior.

These are some of the issues off the top of my head, but I'm sure there are more.

Overall, most of the issues range from minor to hindrance but not deal breakers, until you count how many there are. I find this inexcusable for a flagship device. I've had better experience from beta releases of customs ROMs before. I still hope one day we will actually get a perfect Pixel phone but the Pixel 9 is not it. I thought I will keep mine for a few years but I'm already looking for alternatives.

Comments:
Just sell it and get a device that you'll enjoy.
Hello I'm Karen, i imported the device from other country and hate the product as the OEM follows that country's rules and regulations. 

I will make a reddit post and be shameless about it
I experienced none of your issues. Granted, my comparison is with S22 Ultra and not S23 Ultra.

>Warning: negative experience ahead. Fanboys beware

Top notch way to start this out. Can't wait.

>Other phones will enable the option if you have an international SIM card. My SIM is not japanese and my google account is not associated with japan in any way so why is the option still disabled.

Because you could install a cheap, foreign sim, disable the option, not put your Japanese sim back in, and now you have a phone that's out of compliance with Japanese law.

>Gemini advanced free 1 year trial failed to activate on my account, and I tried 2 other accounts to no avail.

Probably because your accounts are tied to locations where the phone isn't available. But also (and I understand you may feel this way): who fucking cares? AI engines are largely bullshit, anyway. Get that shit out of my life forever.

>The phone can't handle rotations with gesture controls. Many many times when I switch to portrait from landscape the gesture bar will stay at the side until I swipe home from the side, then the screen will flash and get fixed.

Gestures are just that. Gestures. There is no ""gesture bar""... Are you talking about the navigation bar that's used in place of gestures?

>Sometimes when I copy my credit card number it only pastes the last 4 digits? very bizzare and sounds like an app specific issue but my Samsung never did this.

Almost certainly app-specific. Auto-fill almost never does this for me, but copying and pasting does depending on the layout of the CC information. Happens on desktop all the time too, and I don't use Google products on my desktop.


I got nothing for the camera.


Honestly, as at least one other person pointed out: it mostly sounds like you expected a lot of things from a phone that wasn't available to a specific market, and are upset that you either don't have features you wanted, for that reason, or have to abide by the regulations of the market you chose to shop from.
I'm on my 4th Pixel. I love it. Sounds like a user error.
Might look into reaching out to customer support for help activating your 1 year premium subscription. That's a guaranteed promotional offer, so they'll help you set it up somehow.

As for your camera issues, perhaps test a different p9p if you know anyone with one. If their phone doesn't have the same issues then contact support for a replacement. I have the p9p xl and do not experience the issues you mention, and the camera is hands down better than the s24ultra and iphone 16 pro max from my experience.
Good for you
Why did you get it from Japan? Can you not buy it from Google or the USA? Also check if the phone not being available in your region might be the reason Gemini isn't working.
Pixel experiences seem to be hit or miss. My 8pro xl gave me a ton of problems. The 9pro xl has been amazing. 

Camera is the best I've used on a phone. But I'm also a photographer so idk if that's a factor.  .

Android handling of a rotated screen is and has always been absolutely horrific. It's not just the pixel 9 unfortunately.
I have the P7P. I'm hoping it will hold out until the P10 comes later this year, but the battery is starting to fade. 🤞
I have a P9P Pro. It works fine. The only thing that was an issue was that I tried to open the sim slot but it will not open. I used two different tools but no go. I had to use an esim.
I've had every Pro Pixel since the 7 Pro, and while I'm not encountering every issue you listed, the software on my 9 Pro is also far from as flawless as pretty much every YouTuber is making it out to be unfortunately.

I got the 9 Pro after getting tired of huge phones, and with everyone saying the battery was finally great (supposedly), I jumped ship to the smaller Pro despite not planning on upgrading initially. 

This phone has so many little issues that the praise it gets baffles me. Moon shots are basically unusable whereas they used to be pretty great on my 8 Pro, what the hell? The battery is also basically the same as my 8 Pro, which is fine by me since it's the smaller model and I didn't plan on upgrading initially, but after expecting it to be better, I got deceived (that's on me of course).

But the worst of all is the biometrics. The fingerprint scanner basically never works when my thumb is too dry, which in my case is way more often than it being too moist (which is an issue of optical scanners) - but I never expected to have issues with the ultrasonic one. As soon as I get my finger wet with a gentle lick or whatever else, it's recognized immediately. Also in the dark when face unlock fails instantly because it knows there isn't enough light, sometimes (at random) the fingerprint scanner doesn't read anything until I dismiss the biometrics prompt and try again - WHY? What is this bug about?

I love most of this phone, but man, for some reason I feel like I had less issues on my 8 Pro last year. It's good but frustrating.
That's the plan. I'm just sharing my experience. It's a shame because all the issues I mentioned are software related and can theoretically be fixed
Next he'll complain about why his phone can't make him Pizza for lunch
Yes dude half those issues are from being imported.
read the first line of the post
1- Connecting to Japanese cell towers is enough to lock out the option on other phones. 
2- My brother activated his subscription just fine. I didn't care enough to pursue the issue with google support
3- There is a white gesture bar on the bottom of the screen It gets stuck on the side and home gesture doesn't work until you swipe from that side once, then the screen flashes and it's fixed. Happened more than a few times.
4- gboard clipboard only shows the last 4 digits for some reason. I used the same apps on Samsung also with gboard with no issue, which is why I'm saying it's bizarre.
5- I wish this sub allowed photos i have a few examples of the issues I'm facing with the camera, like screenshots from videos that look perfect but photos with the same zoom that look like absolute mess
p.s. i hate reddit comment formatting on the app, new line doesn't work sorry about that
My brother has the same phone. The night mode is terrible and always shows the sky with a lot of noise instead of pure black. Also check the video i referenced from IDTR of gcam v9.6. I have the same experience and it is still not fixed in v9.7. The photos generally are better than Samsung, but Samsung + GCAM app wins hands down
It was the easiest option to import. My brother imported from the US and it worked for him, but he says it's not worth it over regular Gemeni so I don't really care much to pursue the issue
i consider myself an amateur photographer, and the camera is the main reason i got this phone. I wish this sub would allow photos so I can show the issues I'm facing
I'm glad I have sweaty hands then. I didn't get the previous pixels because of the optical sensors. If I had issues with pixel 9 i would have returned it the same day. Also yes, I encountered many bugs with the biometric prompt, like popping up over my camera shutter button when I open the camera by double pressing the power button
What do you mean by your thumb being too dry? Have you tried using other fingers to unlock your phone? I have both of my thumbs and index fingers on my phone, I might have problems when they're wet but never dry.
I also miss my s23 ultra. But then I miss my pixel when I'm using Samsung.
I went from s4 (you could really easily n this cheaply, replace the batteries) to the the pixel 6 (honestly think it was a lemon cuz I had a number of issues.... Some Google related but others seemingly not) switched back to the s21 basic until 3 weeks ago.... Loved the s21 but wanted to go from Google fi to spectrum Plus so I don't have to worry about batteries and my old s21 couldn't make the switch.... For the 9 pro XL...There's some pros and cons but basically if u like the camera and Gemini (only reason I'm staying) go pixel but s25 has better specs for raw power and battery life for those that's important for... And of course if ur a fan boy of either one, just go with that lol
And why can't it walk his dog😂
And I'll be double Karen and put that it will trigger fan boys 


But I'm Karen so anyone who doesn't agree with me is a fan boy automatically
I would contact support this and the credit card issue might be a region issues. What country do you live in?
That's also one I've had too yeah! I don't care too much about it, but it definitely makes no sense that you can unlock the phone while in the camera from the lock screen and it'll unlock and bug out.

Crazy that I get downvoted for speaking my experience in an honest way. I love Pixels, but man, the clique vibe this sub gives is not my cup of tea. Google has always had bugs every year, and this one is no exception to the rule. Obviously bugs won't all be encountered by everyone, but burying someone sharing theirs doesn't help anyone either
I really don't know how else I can explain dry fingers lol, not to be mean of course but it seems self-explanatory. When my skin is too dry, the fingerprint sensor simply doesn't recognize any finger, as if nothing's on the sensor. As soon as I apply some moisturizer, it detects my finger without fail. Weirdly enough, never had any issue when they're wet, even while it's raining and the screen is full of water droplets (that was an issue with optical scanners on my previous Pixels)
Get both. Problem solved.
nah dogs are haram bro
Experience is subjective. I'm sharing my experience. I'm glad you're happy with your pixel
I'm in Saudi Arabia. The credit card issue is so bizarre because it doesn't always happen, but when it does even the clipboard shows just 4 numbers
Have you ever done a livescan? Same issue, when your finger is too dry, livescan cannot read your fingerprints. You have to apply moisturizer to get a reading


Which is to say, this isn't a phone issue. If other phones unlock fine in this case, then they aren't really reading your fingerprints and are not really secure.
Using your phone is haram bro

GooglePixel,Pixel 9 terrible autobrightness,"I have base 9 model and autobrightness is turned on. I know that it should adapt to user's adjustments over time, and I've adjusted it many times daily. It definitely got better but still, especially when phone is lying down on the table, brightness can suddenly go down and few seconds later go up to previous state. This sudden jumps are very irritating. I think that sensor reacts even on smallest shade like from my finger being on phone. Nothing so far fixed this weird behavior for me. Base Pixel 9's owners, are you satisfied with autobrightness behavior? Even my old P5 was better. 

P.S. Sorry for my English, not the first language
Edit: grammar mistakes fixed

Comments:
If you just bought it there is a fix. According to what I have read, the device has saved the configurations of your old pixel and that's why brightness is like that. You have to reset the adaptive.brightness configurations
I agree, it's terrible compared to older pixels.
I think this is intentional behaviour pumping up to 120hz for a 10-15sec then back down. Battery conservation or something like that .
Yes, I've reset it multiple times already. But thank you for help anyway! I think it just bad implementation. Google needs to consider proximity sensor: when there are objects in front of phone, brightness shouldn't suddenly decrease if these objects placed here only for 1-2 sec. IPhones I think work this way
Just leave it alone, resetting it multiple times just sets the learning back.  Reset once, then adjust brightness as you need to.  Give it a few weeks, and slowly you won't need to adjust brightness any more.  I was frustrated too, initially, but after a few weeks it started working exactly how I like it.  I haven't manually adjusted the brightness in months now.
Got mine like a week ago. Autobrightness was pretty bad. But it improved rapidly over the last couple of days.",2025-02-08 11:14:12,6,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ikl33i/pixel_9_terrible_autobrightness/

Comments:
Don't worry about it, at some point you did a factory reset on a device or something
Don't worry about it. At some point you probably wiped data for Wallet, so it's telling you that it's deactivating the old ""session"". This shouldn't actually remove cards from Wallet, and everything should continue to work on your phone as it has been.

I got a similar notice on my Pixel 5 a few days ago.
Really? One of my banks emailed me about the deactivation.
Are your cards still visible in Wallet? That's all you need to worry about.
Is it possible it was a phishing email from a scammer?
My banks always email me anytime I add or remove a card from Google Wallet or Apple Pay. It's standard procedure.
Yes they are.

The iPhone is indeed a bit louder, they both have similar setups in regards to where and how the speakers play sound though.

GooglePixel,Home wifi router keeps crashing when using Google Pixel 9,"Hello Reddit!

My partner and I are experiencing a weird issue that we are nowhere near qualified to fix.

My partner recently got the new Google Pixel 9 and it keeps causing our router at home to crash and restart. It happens constantly! We're 100% sure it's the phone and not something else; we've tested the wifi out by connecting reconnecting devices, but as soon as it's connected to the phone, the router crashes. All other devices work just fine.

We thought it had to do with app updates being queued to download once on wifi, so we tried making sure to always download them before trying to connect to the home wifi, either over data or using the wifi at work, but even then it still occurs.

Has anyone else experienced this issue?

If it helps, out router model is DIR-1950. Maybe it's old and needs replacing? I'm not sure :(

If anyone here can help figure out what's going on I'd really appreciate it!

Thanks!

2. Galaxy Watch Ultra trade in deal at Samsung for $400 trade in credit. Total $250.

People say features are missing when not using the a Galaxy phone. Can the Galaxy watch use Google pay? Trying figure which one I should go with. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Comments:
I'm using the Pixel Watch 3 right now, the Wi-Fi version. I like it a lot. It easily lasts 36 hours for me with always on display enabled. The most underrated aspect of this watch is real time heart rate monitoring. No other smart watch does that apart from Garmin and other fitness focused watches. The accuracy of the sensors is very high as well.
I use a galaxy watch with pixel 7p and Google pay works fine.
I did try both and now I'm using the Pixel Watch 3 46mm.

I personally prefer the Galaxy Watch Ultra in terms of design but the UI and smoothness are much better on the Pixel Watch 3. 

If you are using a Pixel phone though I would recommend getting a Pixel Watch 3 as it gives you a much more seamless experience.
The only restrictions on using a Galaxy Watch with a non-Samsung phone are the Health Monitor (ECG) app and DND/Bedtime syncing. These can both be fixed using community provided solutions. [Health Monitor solution](https://xdaforums.com/t/restrictions-removed-samsung-health-monitor-wearos-phone-1-3-3-002-watch-1-3-2-025-root-age-country-restriction-removed-4th-sept-2024.4322527/), and [DND/Bedtime solution](https://github.com/Silleellie/dnd-bedtime-sync). They both require you to use ADB a bit, but are fairly simple to do, and I've used them both without issue for several years at this point.
I'm using Galaxy watch 7 with Pixel 8 Pro and Google pay doesn't work in the watch. 

FYI: I'm in India.
Currently using a galaxy watch 7 (not ultra) with my P9PXL. I like the form factor of the GW7 better, but it is missing some features exclusive to pixels. I have nest cameras and the galaxy watch does not support camera video view on it. 

I've heard that Pixel watches have better battery too. 

I'm waiting to switch to the the PW4 when it comes out since I heard that they are going to be made repairable vs the current ones which cannot be.
Honestly this is kinda where I am right now. I love what I see from the software side of the pixel watch 3, just wish it had a better build. Considering just dusting off the g shock for a few months, trading in the Apple watch ultra now and getting $230 credit from Best buy in hopes of the pixel watch 4 making improvements on the hardware side. Would love a sapphire option.
I am not a fan of the pebble look either. To me it feels like Google wanted something similar to Apple's yet be different and went with the circular face. Wish they looked different.

GooglePixel,switching to Pixel 9 pro from iphone after 8 years,"the only thing I'm concerned about is if I can transfer all of my passwords 

how would that work?

Comments:
Export passwords file from apple passwords, import the file into google passwords manager
Consider using a proper password manager. 

Bitwarden, for instance. 

Then you can rest assured that all your passwords will always be available, regardless of the device.
Congrats and welcome!
They are about the only thing that doesn't transfer. I just kept my iPhone to look them up for about a week or 2. Not a big deal. The switch is totally worth it.  Android is so much better than iOS
Don't. You will regret it
I did the switch but honestly don't remember. If anything just screenshot them and save to cloud prior if your concerned
Use a password manager such as Bitwarden. It's cross-device capable so you get access to the passwords that you've stored in it on your iPhone, Android phone/tablet, PC, Mac, whatever.

Get everything in there, then when you get your new device, install the password manager on there and your passwords are all there, immediately.
Google's Password Manager -may, just -may help me when I'm making a new password 1' out of 10 times. Usually it (the app) doesn't even come up, and I'm stuck having to come up with a complicated password on the fly. It's so frustrating. I end up forgetting it; then re doing the process all over again. I say get a. Yuby passkey 5C, or a Yuby nano C, or both. Not that expensive, and that is the strongest defence you can get in 2025 for your complying accounts.. Fact Forget password's all together.
I just did that. Really enjoying it so far. 

The only parts i dont like are 1) touch fingerprint reader on screen is a bit finicky, notifications are split out into many categories and i need to disable popups for each one of then individually.
Good choice
Welcome, just reset your passwords if you can't remember them
I made the switch last week.  I recommend exporting your apple passwords and uploading them to a platform like Fastpass.  Its free for 30 days with no card needed so you can get everything transferred without having to pay a penny.

  
I had some passwords that did not transfer / export properly, so a couple of apps i had to reset my password but wasnt a biggie.  One thing to note is if you have any 2fa apps like authenticator, authy etc you will need to note your recovery key down else these will be lost.
Im considering it solely because I keep having to update my iPhone after a certain amount of time & then the jailbreak stuff that I like no longer works.
I switched back in September after about the same amount of time with iPhone. I don't miss it at all
[deleted]
If you have a Mac, there's options to export them using the passwords app. 

I haven't checked but there might also be options to export passwords using iCloud if you don't have a Mac. Not aware of a way to do it using an iPhone or iPad but I'm sure a Google search might help.
How do you do this?
Why. I use GPM and I don't face any issues..
Agreed, Google's password manager is... bad.
agreed! i just moved from iphone to pixel. there was two seconds of setting Bitwarden as the default password app, then boom, all accessible again.
either that or dashlane, but its pretty pricey
Bitwarden doesn't offer to save passwords for newly created accounts which is a deal breaker for me
In what ways? Can you tell some
That's actually a good thing because it allows you to fine tune what you want to be notified about. E.g. I don't want Twitter to notify me about Live Spaces, Recommendations or whenever someone I follow tweets. I *do* want to know if someone interacts with one of *my* tweets. Notification categories lets you tune that. Hiding this in OneUI 6, or rather making you jump through hoops to get it back, is one of the many reasons I went off Samsung devices.
I do that. LOL 😆 This also makes my passwords new, just in case of data leaks.
You stuck with a phone because you couldnt transfer passwords?  Amazing
Sounds like you just needed an excuse to stick to Apple. Don't blame you, their entire business model relies on user stupidity. 
""Hey google, how do i do anything at all?""
More customizable, better call quality, actual spam call screening, you can use a launcher, side loading apps, multiple app stores, way more choice in phones, watches, buds, etc.
It has it's uses but as someone who detests popup notifications, I'd love a way to turn them off completely everywhere or even for every app individually. Some of my apps have over 20 categories of notifications which all need to be changed manually.
Careful, with AI this could result in instructions that shoot up your mailbox and teleport your phone to Zanzibar.
No they don't. At the top of the list of categories there's a toggle that allows you to switch the lot off.
Toggle for categories is there which turns off notifications. I only want to turn off popups.",2025-02-07 00:08:39,56,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ijhohm/switching_to_pixel_9_pro_from_iphone_after_8_years/

I have used the ac68u for ages with no issue but figured I'd bite the bullet and get an ax86u pro. Got it set up and on my 500/500 fiber I get great speeds on all my devices... but my Pixel 9 Pro. For the life over me I can only get 420ish DL and 250ish UL. I tried every fucking channel, setting, etc... even using AsusMerlin and for some reason the 9 Pro just won't get the right speeds. I then put the ac68u back and while the DL is slower the upload is back to 475. 

Because I get fast speeds with my AC but not the AX I have to think this is some sort of bug; but wanted to know if anyone else had experience with this?

GooglePixel,No way to wirelessly charge Pixels quicky anymore,"So perhaps I have just missed something, but it seems to me like my Pixel 8 supports ""quick"" wireless charging only in combination with the Google's proprietary Stand 2 and without it, it maxes out at 12 W input which btw I have never even gotten close to on any compatible charger. 

My question is, now that the Stand 2 is officially discontinued and the Pixel 9s seem to only support 12 W QI charging (even the Pro XL, which can't be true, right?), **is there now no way to utilise my phone's full wireless charging capabilities???**

Please say I have just gotten it wrong... because I really wish I have. Otherwise, this would be a complete failure to comply with their own rules promising (years long) hardware and software support. 

Comments:
I mean I get it but you're stretching a bit saying ""failure to comply""

Wireless charging works fine.
I bought a cheap two pack on amazon (anker  I think). Didn't look at any specs apart from it's a wireless charger. Never had an issue from pixel 7 nor now with the 9 pro
No
You can still buy the Stand 2 at Best Buy
Lots of options here:

[Best Google Pixel 9 wireless chargers in 2025](https://www.androidpolice.com/best-google-pixel-9-wireless-chargers/)

A couple there do 15W.
No, it doesn't. I can't charge at the maximum speed because they won't allow me to buy the only charger capable of that.

edit:
I am based in the EU. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT BESTBUY IS.
I have got some Qi wireless chargers as well. But the charging is way too slow in comparison with the wired one. It doesn't make sense for me to use them in most cases.
I have got a P8... It's written right above⬆️⬆️⬆️
Sure you can. Buy a pixel stand 2.  They're available all over the place. Not even used. Brand New in box. 

Or, and hear me out here, use literally any other compatible charger and not even really notice the difference since 1) it's only that fast for part of the charge curve, and 2) if you don't specifically toggle it to max it stays at the 15w optimized setting..
I charge overnight. I don't care how fast it does that. In fact, slower is probably better. 


During the day, I put the phone into my Qi enabled car dock. Easily keeps the phone at 100%, even on days when I only drive short amounts. 


Even when not charging at all during the day, my phone doesn't even come close to requiring a charge before the end of the day. 


Fast charging is completely overrated. It looks great on paper, but in real life, I haven't felt the need for it in a very long time. It's not the days of the Nexus 5, when I had to worry about topping the phone off regularly
Pixel 9, Pixel 8... they both charge the same way.
It's 12 W at most specified and like I said, I have never been able to get close to that value.

Do you need anything more than Google themselves saying it's discontinued? 
https://store.google.com/gb/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen?hl=en-GB

And what about P8P users who now jump from 23 W to 12 W wireless? Like, dude, what is your point? 

If by ""not even used"" you mean relying on 3rd party resellers selling their last stock, then I say you have got to be kidding. Right?
WHAT? I have an 8 Pro, so these chargers cannot possibly work with my phone too, right?!
Well, no, but they both charge equally slowly without the Stand, yeah. 

""Wireless charging rates up to 15W (Pixel 9), up to 21W (Pixel 9 Pro) and up to 23W (Pixel 9 Pro XL) charging with Google Pixel Stand (2nd gen). Up to 12W with Qi-certified EPP chargers (sold separately). Actual results may be slower.""


""Wireless charging rates up to 18W (Pixel 8) and up to 23W (Pixel 8 Pro) charging with Google Pixel Stand (2nd gen) (sold separately). Up to 12W with Qi-certified EPP chargers (sold separately). Actual results may be slower."" 

The problem is that the Stand 2 can't be had from Google anymore. I am not saying that's making my phone useless, but they took away my opportunity to use one of its features.
You do realize how charging works, right...? Because I don't think you do. 
For wired charging, your device will tell the cable and plug to supply x amount of power, which is usually a higher wattage in the first 40~%. After that, it will lower the wattage to reduce heat and prevent a fault. Your phone does most of its heavy charging the first half of charging because the wattage is higher. 


For wireless charging, you are literally sending electricity to and from the stand. Thermal and connectivity inconsistencies abound. Your use case is nit-picky and kind of nonsensical to me. 
I own a P6A that takes ages to charge, but you know what? My device doesn't turn into a hand warmer at the 40% mark because I use the charging limit, and that's fine. 80% last me at least a day and I'm not destroying my battery. Your phone will also charge at a lower wattage to reduce wear on the battery. All things to consider with your niche usage. 
You're in luck! They work with your phone too! 😂
There is nothing you can teach me about wireless charging and battery chemistry that I don't already know. It's actually a major of mine... Anyway, i am not the designer, the Google Hardware team is and they did their research and design and decided that 18 W is feasible - so feasible, actually, that they make it the first value you read when studying the tech specs in the wireless charging section. The drawback is that it's only possible with the Pixel Stand 2, which is perfectly fine, HOWEVER, that's no longer available (and will not be available) for purchase in my country where Pixels are officially distributed, because they have discontinued the product.

GooglePixel,Android Auto only partially working even after Feb update,"I want to make sure that I'm not missing something on my Pixel 9 Pro XL  
I want to say it was beginning January, probably after the Jan update, I noticed I could no longer use Ok Google On Android Auto.  But worse off, I can't communicate to anyone for phone calls.  Let me back up to Ok Google: I can say ""Ok Google"" (and its only setup to respond during android auto) and it will react, but then it just sits there waiting... very patiently.  Could wait 3 minutes before it gives up.  No matter what I say, it never seems to respond.

I know with my headset (Sony WF-1000XM4), I can still do tap and command things, so I'm at a loss here.

I also remember that there was one other time it basically did this which I believe it was October and was fixed with a specific Android Auto update combined with an android update and I had the Pixel 7 Pro then.  So I'm hoping its the same way here.

I've read so many things from here to other subreddits that it almost sounds like its just specifically an Android 15 issue, but I know at one point, if I got rid of the connection to the car on Bluetooth and removed the car's info about the phone, then re-added it, it would work for calls, but I still couldn't use Google Assistant for making calls or messages.

Looks like I saw something about Android 16 may have the real fix, but its still in beta.  That can't be the only way to fix, would it?

GooglePixel,My personal experience switching from Pixel 9 Pro XL to Oppo Find X8 Pro,"Finally, i found find x8 pro in white which has the extended warranty in my country. The switch was overwhelmed. 

The performance is way better, so does the battery life and charging speed ( about 20-30% difference)

Coloros is not difficult to get used to. It is quite customizable. The stock launcher is awesome, but i really missed the ability to use the Niagara launcher smoothly as the Pixel ( which is my favorite launcher )

When it comes to photography, each device has its own advantages. Find x8 pro has better sensor and zoom, pixel 9 pro xl has better algorithm 

For the ergonomics... Pixel 9 pro xl takes the win. The power-volume button and fingerprint placement is way smarter than find x8 pro. With the find x8 pro I need to get used to it a little compared to the pixel.

GooglePixel,Pixel 8 Display Issues Are Becoming a Serious Concern,"Lately, I’ve been seeing daily posts from Pixel 8 users reporting display issues. This is really concerning because not everyone buys a new device expecting to send it to a service center for repairs shortly after purchase. When people invest in a phone, they expect reliable hardware, which is a major reason why many trust iPhones—not just for their build quality but also for the strong support they offer.

Honestly, I’ve never seen this many hardware complaints about an iPhone compared to what’s being reported for the Pixel 8. This should be a wake-up call for Google to take these issues seriously.

Some users are reporting display problems after just 3–4 months of use. I purchased my Pixel 8 around 3 months ago, and I’m genuinely worried I might be next. This is my only phone, and I rely on it for both personal and work purposes—I can’t afford to be without it even for a day because I don’t have a backup device.

What Google Should Do:
Offer additional warranty options like refunds or upgrades to the Pixel 9 or Pixel 8 Pro for the units that are under warranty. 

Google needs to address this issue proactively before more users are affected.

Has anyone else faced this? What has your experience been like with Google’s support?

GooglePixel,Tensor G4 for not gamer?,"Hi all,

I'm really considering changing my current phone (Xiaomi Mi9T pro) to a Pixel 9 Pro and the thing that scare me the most is that all reviewers, while comparing it to other top tiers, always mention the lower performance. 

But are we talking about ""meaningful"" performance deficiencies? 
I'll explain: is it something you can experience while gaming or can you feel it over moderate work usage?
High demanding conditions I can imagine in my current situation may be:
- Google Maps navigation + Hotspot + spotify
- Home Banking + Mail + Excel 
(with split screen or picture-in-picture condition) 

Thanks in advance 

Comments:
Phones are not for gamers if we're keeping it real.
Don't let people sway you with the Tensor is not designed for gaming stuff. A flagship chipset should perform well in all conditions. That said, no you won't notice any major performance issues unless you game a lot.
You only will notice the tensor chip lacking if you compare it side to side with a Snapdragon while gaming.

Outside of that, you won't notice a thing.
For your usage and more, a Pixel is a great choice. You also benefit from rapid updates from Google and very good monitoring. 
Which is not the case for Xiaomi, not to mention the bloatwars that Xiaomi loves
The Tensor G4 is in every metric worse than current or last gen snapdragon flagship chips. If you buy a pixel do so for it's other features. People saying it's not for gaming are trying to rationalize spending 900 dollars for a mid range chipset
Not a phone gamer, 


The Tensor still has issues with heat which drastically slow down the phone and sometimes result on being unable to do things like upload photos to Google Photos. 

So it's definitely still a problem, even for people who don't play games.
The Pixel 9 Pro handles everyday tasks and OS functions flawlessly. I bought it for the early Android updates, amazing camera, and AI performance that the Tensor CPU is tailored for, plus the robust on-chip security. The absence of bloatware is also nice. Unless you're pushing the phone to its limits with hardcore gaming, the performance is top-tier.
Watch this and stop worrying I play Genshin Impact on my P9PXL and it doesn't even get warm. Smoothest phone ever and I came from an iphone

https://youtu.be/DnvbAAKlT3s?si=K4n9O1B4j_Wiy5uw
Bro I'm running a Pixel 3 and satisfied with its speed. The 9 Pro will be fine.
If you don't play games then it will be great for you and you won't notice a difference.
Tensor 4 is based on the Exynos 2400 found in the S24. Watch this video comparing Exynos 2400(Tensor G4) and the Snapdragon equivalent: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-eTSRngwAK0&pp=ygUYczI0IHNuYXBkcmFnb24gdnMgZXh5bm9z

Tensor is a modified version of Exynos, but they're mostly the same and there is only so much you can do to offset the worse performance of Exynos.  Snapdragon isn't always better than Exynos.

 The S22 Exynos was more or less equal to the Snapdragon outside of gaming and emulation for instance.

I'm happy with Pixel personally as someone who has had Exynos Samsungs before, but don't let ppl fool you into thinking Tensor is that much different from Samsung Exynos
Take a look at the made by Google podcast. The episode about the pixel 9 states that the G4 was optimized for sustained, not peak performance and specific use cases like application launching. Like others have mentioned you can do things like game and not feel the phone warm up.

For work I have access to lots of phones and in day to day use it's just as fast as the fastest phones out there. In high performance scenarios you're probably not going to notice.

I have a P9 Pro Fold and I can play many games (e.g Genshin Impact) with the screen unfolded with great performance.
It can game. Just don’t expect to run it highest graphics setting
G4 can play games np, some games not at full fidelity though
Ahhh the mi9t pro. I had the blue one and man, do I miss *that* phone
I switched from a Mi10T Pro to the Pixel 8, and to be fair, the Pixel is totally fine for normal use. I don't play games, so I can't comment on that, but for everyday use, the phone is snappy and I haven't really noticed any slowdowns. So you shouldn't worry too much about your use cases.
What are you planning to play?
Those conditions would be fine. A low range phone should handle that never mind a 9 Pro.
I don't know if I'd say deficient.  For the most part, it's just fine (I've had a Pixel 9 Pro since launch).  However, it has some odd stutters that I think must be the processor.  For example, I double click the power button often to launch the camera and I'd say 20% of the time it will just be a black screen.  I'll hit the power button once, then restart the process, and it will do this 2-3 times.

  
Further, I use Gemini a lot by long-pressing the power button.  It will have a fairly long 4-5 second delay, pretty often - probably 50% or more of the time.  It doesn't sound long, but it really shouldn't happen on a phone that expensive.

  
With that being said, it performs just fine for just about everything, though I do wonder how long it will run smoothly as there are already hiccups even after only 6 months ownership, which is not unlike the experience I had with the Pixel 6, 7 and 8 Pro.
For the non-gaming stuff you mention in your post, the phone will do just fine.  I'm on the older 8 Pro and multitasking isn't an issue other than battery drain.  I routinely run Waze with some cell mapping apps that peg the GPS full time, along with YouTube music and GasBuddy and there's no stuttering or anything like my older phones.

Gaming is fine if they're casual games, but more demanding stuff will either run slowly or only on the lower graphics settings.

I've got Genshin, Honkai Star Rail and Zenless Zone Zero on my phone but only for logging in and collecting things, not for exploring/fighting.  Genshin is especially slow with potato graphics and 30 fps, the others are marginally better but top out at around 45 fps.
I do a lot of video editing and pixel would really struggle. Go for iPhone, Samsung or anything else.
Wait for a pixel 10, I heared there will be a new CPU.
Just go for pixel .
You are gonna love it.
Yes it's not the ideal chip set for gaming. If you ask it on a pixel sub, almost everyone's gonna defend it with their lives. Considered the OnePlus 13? (Possibly slightly inferior camera and UI, but suits better for gaming with a better chipset and cheaper)
I've literally had no issues with any games at all!

I also multitask playing RuneScape whilst watching YouTube, and I'll have P2P going in the background. I don't know of any other multitasking load bigger for my use case. Yes there are 'better' SoC's but really all top line phones can do everything you ask of them.
For non gamers. When was the last time a cellphone couldn't do the tasks you were asking for. I am a PC gamer and live the performance it comes with. I don't play games on my phone. Android phones have been snappy for almost a decade. I just looked up project butter which had a nice impact on phone responsiveness for Android development. It was 12 years ago.....
I'll tell you my experience. This is my second pixel 9 pro XL because the first one would cause my notification panel to flicker whenever I used gps and charged my phone at the same time. The second still has this same issue. The phone warms up when multitasking. If you listen to YouTube and use gps, the frames drop fairly quickly. It does lag for my use. I primarily scroll and read articles, watch YouTube and play games like Pokemon go, and whiteout survival (not heavy games). It handles those games well. This phone struggles with multitasking is where I notice all of the hiccups. Once you start doing multiple things at once, the chip shows quickly that it is not up to par. This is a $800 phone at best. Don't get me wrong, I love the call screening, voice to text and camera. Those are the features that keep me here. If Google gave those features to Samsung, I would run away quickly and not look back. The battery life is improved over the pixel 8 pro. The phone has a decent amount of bugs here and there that never seem to get fixed, despite me reporting them to Google. So, if you can grab it for a good deal ($600-800), grab it. I would not pay more than that for it. It's not worth that amount of money.
Tensor G4 is on par with Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, not as good as current gen but no slouch either. People try to make it sound like it's a low end Mediatek lol.
It's not bad for it, it's just the fact that it's not necessarily designed around it.

Tensor is primarily designed for everyday tasks, with high intensity workloads and gaming coming second.

The Snapdragon chips in other phones are primarily designed for high intensity workloads and gaming, with everyday tasks coming second.

Either phone can game or do intense workloads, it's simply that Tensor isn't strictly designed for it like Snapdragon is. 

Can Tensor game? Yes. Can it do it well over longer periods of time like Snapdragon? Not really.
You're not a gamer if you're playing on a cell phone
I have the Pixel 9 Pro. I can multitask while on the charger with most apps. I usually have door dash running in the background a lot. I multitask all the time off the charger with zero issues from lagging or overheating. My phone does get noticeably warmer when running Roblox. So does my ipad mini. If you want a nice gaming experience you need a gaming laptop or PC. Phones and tablets are just not made to keep up. I came from an s21U and the Pixel works better in multiple ways. If you go look at my older comments I describe more in detail how. The major issues I was having with my s21U are happening to most of the s21 and s22 series. Not just the occasional dud. After 3 or 4 year's Samsung has been tanking their flagship phones with updates. Most pixels seem to function well for closer to 6 years.
I've switched from a mi 11 to a pixel 8 pro and the gaming experience was worse in the first two weeks or so before the phone settled, but now it's on par. Honestly I can't find anything that makes the phone lag now, it won't be 120 fps but it will be more than smooth enough.

Daily use has been much smoother from day one and I've gotten remarks from people (including someone using an iPhone) about how smooth the pixel is.
Pixel phone not use india consumers only us consumers
This. People who care about games own consoles. People who really care about games own PCs. Phones are what you game on if you really don't care, or if you're too broke to afford a console or PC. 
Why?
Agreed!
Yeah a flagship chipset should perform well in all conditions. The G4 is mid range at best
Unfortunately not the case with tensor. If you where to compare it to apples old silicon. It doesn’t come close. I love my pixel 9 pro xl. But I game mainly on my iPhone 13, has way more GPU speeds.
I'll be honest and say I haven't' gamed at all on my Pixel 9 Pro except for super casual Eggs Inc. I did play some Squad Busters during my Pixel 8 Pro times and the G3 was just insufficient. The game was super choppy. I ended up playing on my work iPhone 14 Plus and that was fine as well as on my iPad Pro. It was just shocking how bad the game ran on the Pixel 8 Pro and I thought Supercell games usually run pretty well because they have a pretty wide audience.
You will notice high power draw and the heat is pretty well noticable.
Yeah that was my point! I had to move to Xiaomi after my Huawei started failing (and now I'm back to it since the mi9 screen died) so I'm so fed up with bloatware for way too long
This is the definition of a fan boy. This phone cannot run genshin impact without dropping frames, heating up, etc. I played it on my 9 pro xl, so I know. This is my second phone as well, so no lemon. It's just the nature of this chip. Don't trust what this guy just told you.
Are you sure... My P9P non XL gets hot playing marvel snap...
Do you get stutters in Genshin? I'm on the P9 and I get frequent stutters whenever I do a 360, even on lowest settings.
Samsungs also overheat all the time too. I am so confused on why people believe that's only a google pixel error. My s21U would overheat all the time. There are already reports that the s25 series is having issues with overheating too. The Pixel 9 series seems to be wayyy better at not having that issue as much. My Pixel 9 Pro has stayed nice and cool.
I believe this is the experience you have had. It sounds like you got two duds. I multitask heavy all day and while my phone is on a charger too. I usually have the door dash app running while charging. My Pixel 9 Pro does not warm up like that. It got slightly warm while running Roblox while charging. The rest of my devices I run Roblox on get pretty warm even while not charging. That does not even count as an issue for me. Maybe talk to google about giving you a third replacement.
A lot of mental gymnastics here to say Tensor is a poor performer across the board. It does nothing better than a Snapdragon chip of the same (or even older) generation
Why? Does cloud gaming not exist or something? Remote play for PS? Steamlink? Never had an issue cloud gaming with X-Box or remote playing with PS Remote Play. Sometimes we have time but are away from our PC, PS, or XB.
Some of the best games of all time are available on Phones. What are they? fake games?
Louder for the people in the back!
The type of gaming on a console and PC is totally different than a phone. I don't think it's mutually exclusive. A phone is what you have on you when you have a 45 minute subway commute each day. How is a ""gamer"" going to play on their console during then?

The bar for phone gaming is far different and so the nature of gaming is different too given that you have limited controls on a phone. Even similar games like Wild Rift vs League of Legends is going to be where the phone version is more casual and easier to pick up. This is no different where we don't have PC vs Console gamers in FPS because a mouse and keyboard will always dominate.

The point I'm trying to make is let's stop trying to say phones aren't for a certain group of people. The reality is when I get on the subway in Shanghai I see a significant number of people playing Honkai Star Rail, Genshin Impact, etc, and those games have run poorly on the Pixel in previous reviews. This isn't to say these people are hardcore gamers or anything. None of that matters. What matters is people expect to play the same games their friends are playing and if this device does it much worse, then people do question ""WTF?""

My personal experience when I was using a Pixel 8 Pro was why Squad Busters ran so much worse than on competing Snapdragon flagships and iDevices. I stopped playing on my phone and opted to play on my work iPhone and iPad instead because the game was significantly worse to play on the Pixel. I admit I have not tried playing on the Pixel 9 Pro though.
Check out the stress test In Depth Tech Review did on YouTube. That should answer all the questions you have.
I’m not defending the Tensor’s performance. I mean, I don’t like all that nonsense some hardcore Pixel fans go on about when they say stuff like the Tensor is not designed for gaming. A flagship SoC should perform like one. But for most users, the G4 will do the job pretty well. It’s only gaming or other CPU/GPU intensive tasks where you might notice some performance issues.
I could maybe think of a couple phones where that isn't a thing.
My Pixel 9 Pro is noticeably cooler than my Samsung Galaxy s21U in multiple situations. The older pixels have issues with overheating. They did fix it with the Pixel 9 line.
omg you should try a Pixel you will love it. It has zero bloat and it feels blazing fast
Hmmm. No problem on mine. Sorry. It doesn’t run horribly on my S22 either. Maybe I don’t play Long enough. I get bored after like 45 minutes.
Watch the video. He agrees with me
Really? Mine doesn't
I haven’t seen any. I do need to get better, I play as slow as molasses but it is smooth. No stutters
No thanks. There are people online with the same complaints. 2 phones is enough for me. Put your phone in my hand and I bet it does the same thing lol
Typical post purchase rationalization especially after dropping flagship level money
Oh it's a real game not played by ""gamers""
> The type of gaming on a console and PC is totally different than a phone.

I've done all 3. Experience is definitely the worst on a phone. 

People still game on phones because it's cheap and convenient. You carry it with you everywhere. But the vast majority of people would not choose phones as a platform if they were not constrained by money or convenience. It's not the preferred platform. It's the ""good enough"" platform. 

Might be different in other countries. But in the US, people can usually afford either a console or a PC. Often both. Very few people in the US (and probably Europe) are buying phones as a game platform. I've owned phones in the past that were top tier gaming phones at the time, and I still did not game on them. My PC was just a much better experience.
True, but there's also the heat issue. I've noticed ever since I got my 9 pro xl that if I use tiktok while charging; it gets so hot that the phone thermal throttles
The problem with tensor is efficiency though.
Yeah sure, but no phones with tensor chip\^\^
Yeah, don't think it did at launch, noticed it recently but maybe I'm not used to 40 degrees in my hand. Can you play marvel snap for like 5 minutes with a case off and tell me you don't feel the phone heating up ?
You are absolutely wrong. Sorry lol. I am on this sub all the time. I have not seen a single overheating where it was not a faulty phone. I didn't say your phone didn't act that way. Go read my comment again. Have you done ANY trouble shooting for why it might be overheating? Other than a quick restart? Have you done any beginner adjustments they mention in YouTube videos for setup? Yes, you have a valid experience. You have provided no proof. That you checked to see if you downloaded a random app that overworks in the background. Or that you did any trouble shooting.
The argument isn't which type of gaming is better. The argument I'm making is these types of gaming are not really comparable to begin with because it's not just about which feels better but really accessibility. It's no different than the best camera you have is the one on you--similarly, the best gaming platform is the one you have on you. So if you're on a 1 hour train ride commute, a 3 hour plane ride, or trying to kill time at the office toilet, your PC isn't going to be an option. Neither is a PS5. So you can argue all you want about a PC being the best gaming experience, but if it's not accessible, then that's why people pull out their phones.

These kinds of dismissal about how people use their phones is concerning. I don't game, and many others don't, but for those who do play games on their phone, they will look to why other phones can do it better. And when Snapdragon devices and iDevices can game without problems whereas Tensor sees a significantly worse experience, then people will ask questions. Why do you think Google Pixel has a reputation for underperforming if gaming doesn't matter? It clearly does, but it's not my criteria for device selection, and just because it does, doesn't mean it's suddenly a non issue overall.
That’s strange. My Pixel 8 starts getting toasty with Reels too at times. I thought that vapor chamber in the 9 Pro XL would help it fare better, at least that’s what a lot of other users seem to say.
Exactly! I agree with you 100%
If I were a professional photographer, or even a serious amateur, I would not be using a phone camera. I'd buy a real camera. I could go through the reasons for this, but I think they're obvious. 


That's what I'm arguing here. For most people who are serious about gaming, the best chip in a phone is still trash compared to a PC or console. The phone needs to work as a phone. The GPU is not important to most people. 
It does. I can play Genshin impact for an hour with zero heating. It's better than my secondary S22 and way better than my old iPhone 13 which bogged down bad. Maybe watch this and stop believing the baloney from people that have never even held a Pixel.

GooglePixel,"How do I Get Google to Fix a Problem, or at Least Pay Attention?","The recording functionality of Call Notes at least in Pixel 9 Pro XL is broken - on long calls the audio cannot be played back, and the controls that one would use to play back the audio are grayed out (5 minute call records fine, 55 minute call does not.)

I tried the online support chat and the chat rep was less than helpful, to put it mildly.

Any suggestions on how to get it escalated so Google can fix it?

Comments:
You don't, Google does not care.  If it's widespread enough they'll eventually fix it with an update but getting any acknowledgement from them is low probability. Honestly they are garbage when it comes to any kind of after sale support. I've accepted that I'm essentially buying a as is product regardless.
None of these big companies care about problems that only a minority care about or experience. It's only when people come together and start reporting and complaining everywhere that they might take action. Notice the word might. Even if people complain about something they can go years and years without ever addressing it. 

Just have to learn to accept these things and if there are too many problems then switch to another device. It sucks.
Have you tried getting in touch with them via call? Because, I recently faced a network related issue on my pixel 6a, and I instantly got support from Google via their call center.
Where do the files save? Are you sure there is enough space for the calls to properly and fully save to the location?

During the 55 minute call, are you doing anything that would cause you to lose WiFi connection (like leaving your original location and driving around or somewhere else)?
Wait, you can RECORD phone calls?? To be fair, my phone tech skills peaked in like 2015 🤣
UPDATE: I figured it out! Yay me! 😂
Submit feedback or a submit a bug report (gets assigned to a developer you can interact with) after resetting your phone and verifying that the issue no longer exists. This is very common. Updates can soft or hard break many things that are unforeseen in perfectly clean test environments.
Welcome to Google ""customer"" no support!!
They took like 8+ months to fix the widevine bug on their security update caused...
Hey, so this probably won't help, but this is likely a limitation of Gemini Nano which does the on device call notes processing.

I say this because I noticed a similar issue with summarizing 50 minute meeting recordings where it will refuse to summarize and says it's unable to; when it does fine with 10 minute ones. 

I've not used call notes, personally, but if there's a way to just export the audio files you might want to try that.
Huh, that's weird
Was the person at the call center easy to understand?  I usually opt for chat when possible as there is less of a language barrier.
It's not a new thing but it depends on your region, the feature is locked in most places because of local law - which is DUMB since there's nothing stoping you from using a separate recorder, but can't really blame google for complying with dumb regulations.
Here's the funny part - the written transcript and summary, which presumably involve some Gemini processing, are just fine for the entire hour.  It is the audio that is the problem.  The control to play the audio on the phone and the one to download the audio are both grayed out,
Usually I also go for the chat, but the person on the call was very helpful, they even helped me with other issues too, those I didn't mention in form, they sorted it too.
My first language isn't english, and I'm not fluent in that either, but the person there helped me very patiently.

Ok but the things you have mentioned are mostly a software thing. 

Perhaps you are just unlucky enough to have a real, physical motherboard issue, but these things also happen to those users of Apple products who are equally unlucky.

1- the UI is made for the average user. Don't except customisations unless you're rooted.

2- Settings - About phone - Tap 7 times on Build number to enable Developper mode - go back to the Settings page once and you'll notice a new menu called Developper settings - within you'lll find AI Core Settings - enable the switch

3 + 4 - unlocking the phone allows to flash full firmware and install Magisk to root. A tool like PixelFlasher (XDA Forums, Github) does the job.",2025-02-04 18:14:06,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1iho9b4/new_android_user_need_help/

Hi there, try clearing the cache of the 'Pixel Launcher' app to see if that helps.

Go to Settings app > Apps > See All Apps > Pixel Launcher app > Tap Storage & cache > Clear cache > Restart the device.

Also, try rebooting your phone into [safe mode](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2852139#zippy=%2Cif-your-phone-is-on%2Cif-your-phone-is-off) and see if that resolves the issue.

If it works fine in safe mode, it means a 3rd party app is causing the issue. Temporarily remove them one by one, starting with the most recent until you find the cause.

GooglePixel,Gboard freeze,"I have a Pixel 9PXL , and I use Gboard . From time to time it freeze for 1,2 sec and then the pressed keys appear . Prevoiusly I had a Samsung S22 Ultra and switched to samsung keyboard for the same reason.

Why is this happen ? Are there any solutions? 
Beside this , Gboard is the best keyboard I used and it's frustrating. 

Edit: if I try to clear cache it's good for a while. But what is causing it?

Comments:
I have the same issue on my P9 and also had it on my old phone. Some people said that disabling the ""Share usage stats"" option would fix it, but it doesn't. It's frustrating to have a new phone lag while typing..

If anyone finds a good enough replacement for gboard please let me know.
Hi there. Could you try uninstalling and reinstalling the Gboard app updates and see if that helps?

Uninstall app update:

Go to Settings > Apps > See all apps > Gboard App > On the top right, you’ll see 3 dots > Uninstall updates > Tap OK.

Once it is done, you can reinstall app update:

Open Play Store app > Tap the Profile icon (top right) > Manage apps and device > You can check for pending updates under Overview > Update Gboard app.

Also, try rebooting your phone into [safe mode](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2852139?hl=en&sjid=16956042036264041159-AP) and see if that resolves the issue. If it works fine in safe mode, it means a 3rd party app is causing the issue. Temporarily remove them one by one, starting with the most recent until you find the cause.
As stated in edit , the only solution is to clear the cahce from time to time , so no , it's not a third party app fault. 
Also , the updates are not relevant . As stated , the problem is not recent , was present on the old phone , so no , updates are not causing this neither.

And from what I read on the internet , it's a known problem.

GooglePixel,Pixel 9 Pro Finger print sensor,"Morning Guys,
Earlier in the year I updated my pixel to android 15, sadly afterwards I noticed that the finger print sensor was failing (during most of the scans). I recall seeing a number of posts on this, with other experiencing similar issues. 

Eventually I sent the handset back to Google as it was unusable and they sent me a new one out with Android 14.

My questions is, have Google since fixed the issue with the fingerprinf sensor through another updated, or is it best to stay android 14 for now. 

I also have a pixel 8 pro and reluctant to update to Android 15 because of the same reason.

Thanks

GooglePixel,Help please! eSIM transfer issue with my new Pixel device,"Hi teampixel, I was using Pixel 4a for almost 4 years now (in India). I got a new Pixel 9 Pro and have been trying to transfer my eSIM to the new device. I downloaded the same on the new device but the network is not connecting on it.

I have doubt that once I delete the eSIM on the 4a, it will allow the new sim to work. Is it like that?
I'm scared that once I delete the eSIM, I might get in trouble. Kindly help, if you navigated a similar situation, especially in India!

Comments:
It's normal for a connection to the network working only on one (e)SIM at a time. 

If you think about it, it makes sense: you would have multiple phones connected to the same line simultaneously. 

That is the most probable cause for the eSIM only working on one device, and not on both.
Thank you for your reply! So shall I go ahead and delete the esim from the old phone?
Just curious if you transferred your esim like this?
No call your eSIM provider . Sometimes there is a new eSim needed when transfer to new device
This. 

Ask if they will create a new eSIM, or if you can use the current one.",2025-02-04 10:31:22,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1iherij/help_please_esim_transfer_issue_with_my_new_pixel/

GooglePixel,S22 Ultra to Pixel 9 Pro?,"I'm looking at upgrading to the Pixel 9 Pro from the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra but I'm on the fence. Has anyone else made the same jump or similar and have any advice or feedback? 

Comments:
Yesterday I just did the change from S22+ to the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and I'll be honest to say that there's a few of no brainer features missing on the pixel... a google phone that should be the epitome of customization. Here's some:

- Naivgation bar at the bottom cannot be remapped, you're forced to be pressing ""back"" button on the left. 
- Background app viewer style cannot be customized and do not have a convenient kill-all button. You have swipe manually all the way to the first app to see the ""close all"" button.
- Gallery app (Google photos/gallery). When browsing your photos in different folders, you can't view the photos altogether as its splitted up by dates. Samsung gallery app is much more intuitive.
- Just found out that the Pixel phones are still being plagued by notification delays, which I'm affected too and trying to fix it.

There's playstore alternatives on some samsung features (e.g. edge tab), but still its pretty frustrating for me that Pixel only good feature is the camera. I'm using Nova launcher on both phones, so if you had bad time with One Ui, then the Pixel should be a pleasant experience for you.

Probably gonna be down-voted heavily but I want to share the constructive criticism so at least you know what you're getting into.
My fiancé switched from S22U to P9P. She loves the size, battery, fingerprint scanner and camera, dislikes the lack of Samsung Gallery
Just do it IMO, there's a few [Samsung features and customizations](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1d0kjtm/things_missing_in_pixel_ui/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) that you'll miss or need to get third-party apps for if you use them, but the p9p has a better/faster camera, display and is current. 
In my opinion you will love it.
Pixel is much more stable compared to one ui.
I had the s22u ~2 years ago for a ~2 weeks but returned it. I have a P9P rn. The P9P is super comfortable to hold and performance is solid for my daily use. I get 1-2 days of light use (social media, texting, yt etc).

If you ask why I returned the s22u:

It was very uncomfortable to hold and I didn't like OneUI.

The Pixel are a bit underpowered but If you are not always gaming or run your phone at 100% you won't feel it
Just keep the s22 ultra, not much of an upgrade from where I stand.
I went from an S22 Ultra to a P9PXL.
Honestly, the navigation bar is no big deal. I swapped the back and recents button on mine as the phones I've had before all had it that way. It just makes more sense to me but I know that isn't the case for everyone. 

I typically don't have more than a handful of apps open at one time so the lack of a close all button isn't huge to me but definitely nice to know in the case I do get carried away as I do sometimes bounce between apps alot. 

I haven't touched the Samsung gallery since I've had to reset my phone due to an update last year. 

Notification delays? That's something I haven't heard about yet. 

I appreciate your feedback since you've done a similar jump to what I'm considering! I know you've only had it a day so far but is there anything you think the Pixel does better than the S22+?
I guess that won't be a big deal, I typically default to Google Photos anyway. 😅
The Samsung Gallery is literally the only thing that has more useful features than Google photos. Everything else is better on Pixel. I wish I would have got the Pro instead of the 9 Pro XL though. The boxy design is much easier to hold with the smaller form factor. Vs the Pixel 8 Pro was easier to hold due to the curved edges
I'm in the same boat as your fiance ! I also miss the Samsung gallery after coming from a Samsung Galaxy a53 5g, currently on a Google pixel 9 pro xl. Google photos has me messed up , haven't even been on this new phone for a week yet . Is she experiencing any eye strain ? This phone makes my sight blurry after a short period of time unlike my last phone
Most of those features I can do without, the main ones that are upsetting to lose are the stackable Widgets, and having Folders in the app drawer. Can you explain what the Google Widgets are?
Are the updates more stable? I had to factory reset my s22 ultra after a recent update because TouchWiz kept crashing, and every other update FB messenger gives me ""not compatible with this version"" issues, which are frustrating.
How has it been for you? I'm still on the fence but strongly considering making the jump.
I mainly use my phone on my right hand, so it's more natural for me having the back button on the right where my thumb can reach comfortably.

Yeah you might want to check out the notification delays, there was a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ihgth8/pixel_delayed_notifications/) about it yesterday, and few more recently. Seems like due to very aggressive sleep/battery saver. I have disabled adaptive battery and now testing against my S22+ to see the notifications are coming in as quick.

Good to know that the missing features won't affect you much, then switching to Pixel would provide a fresh experience for you. It is a beautiful phone (though slightly heavier and thicker). Apart from the hardware specs bump and AI gimmicks, i'm afraid to say that Pixel camera is the only thing better functionally (everything else is functioning on par/as expected).
You might want to try different themes and contrast settings that suit you better. the Samsung gallery was the only thing I like more about Samsung's but it was an easy switch to Google photos and it syncs much better
Everything's fine for her. he PWM for both of them should be about the same (pretty low unfortunately). Could it be the brightness of the display as it gets super bright?
Its the ""at a glance"" and search widgets, there's a ton of newbie users asking if you can remove them on this sub but annoyingly you'll need to change the launcher.
S22 doesn't use TouchWiz... but wouldn't say pixels drastically diffent in ""stability""  both have bugs here and there like any device. (On my pixel 8 I've had the gesture bar glitch, stuttery scolling, apps on the homescreen ""grey out"" and the toggle for long app names in the drawer still doesn't work. Iirc ive had fewer bugs on my s21fe) but they're both solid now. 
I really like it! I was a fan of pixel before as I had a pixel 6 before my s22u, I haven't had any issues with my phone! I recommend making the jump!
I'm primarily looking for a better camera and battery life. I also want something fresh which, for better or worse, isn't Samsung this time around.
Maybe ? My old phone didn't do that , so perhaps that's it . I have seen some things when doing research that pixel phones cause eye strain , but I haven't found enough solid evidence
Ahh, okay. Thanks!

I've heard the Tensor G4 is iffy, but wouldn't it still be an improvement over my Snapdragon 8 Gen 1? I don't play any heavy games (mostly stardew Valley, Minecraft, and balatro but only on occasion), so I'm not too worried about gaming performance. I'm mostly worried about how well it can handle editing videos and photos and multi apps like running a YouTube video and edit a document etc. 

Anything else I should know about making the jump? I'm definitely considering it.
Really? I've had numerous times where my s22 ultra has said ""TouchWiz home isn't responding""...
My main concerns are battery life and camera. Would you say they Pixel is better in those areas than the ultra? I think camera is but I'm seeing mixed things on battery. 

Also, how is the screen? I've heard it's comparable but also causes headaches?
I'm not a fan of Samsung's post-processing of the photos, so its a win for the Pixel camera. My S22+ is the snapdragon variant, so battery life on it was good and the Pixel is just as good.

Definitely tick the boxes you're looking for.
Yeah G4 is better than the 8gen1, similar to 8gen2. don't think you'll have an issue editing photos/video and splitscreen (Of course it won't be the fastest but better than the s22u). but fyi [splitscreen are a bit clunky on pixel](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1dc6bgw/split_screen_on_pixel_is_terrible/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), its easier to setup on galaxy. 
TouchWiz was discontinued in late 2016... Where are you seeing that? 
So, I have no issues, I can usually go a full day unplugged and not have to charge throughout, camera is great, coming from someone that takes a lot of photos of my kids. Screen is fine! I suffer from pretty frequent headaches but my screen isn't the problem.
When my S22 Ultra updated late last year the homescreen kept crashing and I kept getting error messages that were alternating between OneUI and TouchWiz ""isn't responding"". It was the same update I think that is mentioned here.

https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/s/zoySS2iYxE
Thats weird...tried a reset? That link sounds similar to what happed with the pixel 6 recently. But regardless the p9p is better.
Yeah, after I factory reset my phone the issue went away. It's not the first time they've sent a OneUI update out and my phone kept crashing. I think my S10 did it as well.",2025-02-04 05:02:54,4,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1iha4vh/s22_ultra_to_pixel_9_pro/

GooglePixel,Pixel 9 Pro XL Keeps Restoring Deleted Texts,"So I just upgraded from a Pixel 7 to a Pixel 9 Pro XL. I signed in on the new phone and restored my new phone with my previous phone's apps, etc. Come to find out, the new phone downloaded every single text message I've ever sent with a Google phone. I went to delete them by swiping them off the screen, and a few moments later they pop up again. I'm not finding much info online about this. Most of all I see is that I somehow have automatic backup enabled. I do not know how to check if that's the case. From what I can see, my new phone says I don't. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Comments:
The messages app might be bugged right now. I noticed today some weird auto brightness bug where it flickers opening the app and when scrolling through the overview of all apps when messages happens to be in them. No other apps do this and the screen doesn't ""flicker"" when opening any other apps. It's just messages. Think it might have to do with refresh rate as when I swipe up to close the messages app it also flickers a little bit. Almost like a pwm flicker. It's never happened before today.

In addition it keeps going back to the middle of threads that are very old
Maybe delete those messages from your old one.
Look to see what your swipe command is.  By default it archives. You can set to swipe delete instead but you need to change the setting. 

If you have an issue about the cloud storage take a look at your back-up settings.
What's the proper transfer method to avoid this?

turn of new phone, put them side by side and sync to new phone and wait 4 hours?
Yes open the setting click clipboard and on this setting
I hope that's all it is. It's driving me crazy
Unfortunately my old one is completely inoperable. The screen went dark, I couldn't even unlock my phone to get into it
You are correct in that the swipe is archiving instead of deleting. Good suggestion. I think it is in issue with backup settings, but when I go to check those settings, it tells me there are not SMS messages being back up. It's a pickle
I left the beta and it seemed to fix my issues
Isn't backup a scheduled event?  Meaning, If you frequently delete your messages through the day, there will be nothing to backup during the next backup cycle.  Also, archived messages are treated different during backup since they are not ""active"" sms message.
How do you do that?
Well what seemed to have happened was, when I got my new phone, I could not delete the messages from my old phone because I could not access those messages. So I'm not surprised to see them on my new phone. However, those messages that were still present on my old phone weren't the only messages that popped up on my new phone. Scrolling through all the messages, it literally looks like damn near every message I've ever sent with every Google Pixel I've ever owned throughout the years is now on my new one. And I know I deleted those down the line throughout the years.

GooglePixel,glass screen protector pixel9," I am looking for a glass screen protector for my Pixel 9 that works with the fingerprint sensor. Does the glass sold on the Google Store work?



Comments:
Get yourself a bunch of cheap ones on Amazon! Glass is glass and glass breaks
If you’re talking about the case-mate one, it does. I used it until I got the Prism 2.0 from dbrand. For most if not all glass screen protectors, you should remove your registered fingerprints and then add them again after applying it.
Just register the same fingerprint twice. That usually works with the cheaper alternatives
I have the one from ringke, not that expensive and is better than any glass protector I had from aliexpress before, fingerprint also works just fine.
Definitely does, but honestly my 9xl has broken more in the 3 months-ish I've had it than my last few combined. I don't know if it's something with the screen shape design or maybe it's just me, but my last phones I maybe broke 1 during their life and this one I'm already on #3.
They all break, but thats not the whole story. The difference in quality can be seen in optical clarity, sometimes cheap protectors are grainy or have a rainbow effect, the oleophobic coating also makes a difference and the fingeprint sensor doesn't work great with all protectors.
You broke your screen 3 times?

I've had this issue many times with my Pixel 7. It sucks that its cropping up on the Pixel 9 series cause I just traded my OP13 for a Pixel 9 Pro.

You need to use ADB to clear the data of google play services. If that doesn't work you need to use ADB to uninstall all updates to the Google Play Services. The package name is com.google.android.gms . Last resort is a factory reset, but that shouldn't be necessary with the right ADB commands. There may also be a corrupted app as well on your device, which you can reset the data of using ADB.
Both on data and wifi, account works fine on desktop and my apple IPad, no vpn, located in UK.

GooglePixel,Pixel 9xl haptics suck,"Anyone have issues with the vibration? It's not strong enough. And iv played around with the haptics. Also sometimes this phone will not vibrate randomly and I'll have a missed call and it says silent mode. Which I don't use silent mode. 

Comments:
Haptics on my 9 Pro are excellent?
I agree. The highest setting on the pixel basically gives no feeling. I used to set gboard.to 33ms or whatever it was.

Now at the highest setting I can't even feel it
.
UI haptics are fire.

The vibration for notifications and phone calls are pure ASS. Crazy how there's such a big discrepancy in the two.
What are you on haptics are one of the best on pixels
Maybe I'm mislabeling the vibration and call settings with haptics.
Finally someone agrees with me. If my phone is in my pocket on vibrate I should be able to feel it when I'm walking. Iv missed to many calls just because of that alone
Can't you change vibration time in Gboard on Pixels?
The pixel vibration and calling features are really bad. Sometimes when you switch over or put on hold it will say you switched but keep ringing or vibrating. It's so maddening. I switched from Samsung.
Unless I'm misunderstanding the vibration is weak.  My Samsung was way better.
No way
They only give a few options on a slider. The highest setting is lower than the original default on GBoard a few years ago..
Google tweaked the vibrations and added cooldown notifications aswell in case you're wondering.
Oneplus and pixels have great haptics. Samsung even on the highest flagships are cheap
Thanks, that's a bummer. On other Android phones (OnePlus, Xiaomi) it's still there , up to 100 ms.
Tweaked in what manner and when?
I can't say much about haptics. But I will say I'm very disappointed with the vibration. Could be way stronger. Samsung excelled at that at least
You can't even adjust the weak haptics of the pixels. The value they use is very low
Yeah I used to set to 33ms but now you just have a few options. The outlet here are cultists so they defend it
Adaptive vibrations with Android 15 when it went stable. Check your system settings.
You can
Oh that. Ya I messed with that but the strength of the vibration for notifications and calls is still very, very weak to where it's practically inaudible.
You can't they give you just a few options where you used to be able to set the specific intensity. 

The highest setting on the pixels now is below the default on most phones
Pixel hater moment. Every other YouTuber says the same that the haptics are good
They are lying or don't know what good haptics are..I'm very disappointed in them. I had the 7 pro and the 9Pro XL

I went through the battery replacement program options and decided I'd like to receive $100 towards my purchase of the Pixel 9. Upon submitting the request I was given a case number and then informed an agent would be in touch within 3 weeks.... So they have offered this $100 reward but now I can't immediately use it?

I can't wait 3 weeks to get a new phone, I've already been dealing with this issue for over a week and it's so frustrating.

Anyone else run into issues with the replacement program, or anyone who successfully used the $100 credit and how long it took for approval/to receive the code?

Sincerely a frustrated customer 🙃

Comments:
Yes, lots of people (my wife included) have been having problems with the 4a program - there are many people with similar stories across Reddit that you can find. Google is really doing long term damage to the Pixel brand with how they are handling this.
I filled out the form and requested the $50 on the 7th and I received a response on the 25th. I filled out the form that day and I have not yet received the $50.
Or you can keep the phone and flash a custom ROM
The Pixel4a Subreddit is up in arms about all of this.

Took me 2 weeks, and only after contacting support multiple times trying to change the $100 rebate to battery replacement after hearing of the horror stories and a lot of the caveats that were not adequately explained when selecting it (can't be used with any other promotions).
I filled out the form two weeks ago today, and finally got my $100 promo code this morning. A little frustrating, given that Google presumably knows all it needs to the moment you submit your request. The software update on the 4a doesn't totally brick the phone, but it sure does mean I had to plug it in five or six times per day.
Ugh that's frustrating, I hope you get your $ soon!",2025-02-03 14:02:40,11,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1igpqze/google_pixel_4a_battery_replacement_program_issue/
GooglePixel,Pixel 9 (Pro) camera bar - Screen protector needed?,"Wondering what experiences people have had with the durability of the camera bar glass? I've used 2 different tempered glass protectors but dust constantly gets under them through the mic gap and goes across the camera lens. Of course the solution is to just take the protector off but I've noticed that due to the bar sticking out of the device (I have a Maus case so the camera without a protector sits flush with the case) both protectors have come off pretty scratched up - naturally I don't want to risk causing damage to the camera bar glass. Thanks!

I'm using the Zagg anti-glare cam protector on my p9p and doesn't effect cam quality in the least. And lifetime warranty

If you do want to get one, I can personally recommend the Spigen one. Easy to fit, very thin and no degradation in camera quality.
Use transparent ppf
I don't use a case and mine looks fine. I set it down on the table or desk all the time.
All this extra protection renders the phone design useless. Have faith in it! (That's my strategy ha!)

GooglePixel,Pixel 9 Call Noise Issue,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been noticing a weird issue with my Pixel 9 during phone calls over a GSM connection. I get random bursts of noise—very brief, just tens of milliseconds long. It doesn’t happen all the time, but when it does, it’s pretty noticeable.

Has anyone else experienced this? Wondering if it’s a hardware issue, network-related, or maybe even a software bug.

How are you listening? Bluetooth headphones? Speakerphone?
This issue occurs during speaker mode and earpiece speaker mode (normal) too..
If you can, try listening over a bluetooth connection. external speaker or earbuds or something. This should tell you if it is a signal processing issue or a hardware issue with your speakers.
The speakers work well. On whatsapp calls everything works fine, the problem occures only on GSM calls",2025-02-03 11:46:02,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ign94q/pixel_9_call_noise_issue/
GooglePixel,Switched from iPhone 12 Pro to Pixel 9 Pro – RAW Photo Quality Issues in Lightroom,"I recently switched from an iPhone 12 Pro to a Google Pixel 9 Pro. I take a lot of photos on my phone and process them using Lightroom. While the photos are noticeably sharper on the Pixel straight out of the camera, I’m running into issues when importing the RAW files into Lightroom.

The problem is that the RAW images from the Pixel appear noisy with faded textures, and they lose the sharpness I see in the original files. I’ve checked the color profiles during import (set to Google Pixel) and experimented with other profiles, but it hasn’t made a difference.

Interestingly, importing JPEGs from the Pixel into Lightroom works just fine—no issues with sharpness or texture. I never faced this problem with my iPhone, where I used Apple ProRAW, and the RAW workflow was smooth.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any suggestions on how to fix this and get a proper RAW workflow with the Pixel?

Comments:
A raw file by definition should be less sharp, less saturated and less saturated than a jpg because a jpg is processed from a raw into the final output.
The whole point of a raw is you do the processing yourself.
Check this post [https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ieoypl/long\_post\_ahead\_my\_honest\_and\_complete\_experience/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ieoypl/long_post_ahead_my_honest_and_complete_experience/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Lightroom applies a filter on there automatically for images from Pixels and you have to turn it off apparently.  I'm switching to Affinity Photo so I'm relearning how to do things.
Well that's what shooting RAW is for, isn't it?
You get the RAW file, i.e. the photo without (most of) the post processing (sharpening, noise reduction, exposure correction etc.) that is otherwise automatically applied to the photo when shooting JPEG.


As far as I know, Apple ProRAW keeps some of the processing even though it's supposed to be a RAW photo.
That might be the difference you're seeing.",2025-02-03 05:05:39,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ighjx0/switched_from_iphone_12_pro_to_pixel_9_pro_raw/
GooglePixel,Google Meet Video Quality,"My video quality on Google Meet is not good. My video is so laggy/choppy. Is there a fix for this? Or is it just another problem waiting for a fix? Really frustrating when trying to video call people. Almost makes me not want to use it but I'm not sure of a better solution. The phone is the Pixel 9 Pro XL, 15 (AP4A.250105.002), Meet Version 288.0.714755500.duo.android_20250112.12_pO. Any help is appreciated!

Comments:
In my opinion, the Google Duo quality was much much better and crisp. Not sure why every few years Google just dump their apps. I hate the integration with Google Meet. Google meet feels like a corporate meeting app like teams and Zoom. Duo felt more personal to me. 

  
Answering your question, Google meet do require a stable internet connection to give you crisp video quality. I don't have any other suggestion, but as I said not happy with the Google meet quality in general.
Out of curiosity, were you on WiFi, 5G, or 4G?  I don't use Meet very frequently (typically use Teams, sometimes Zoom) but someone sent me a Meet link last week and I was pretty impressed with the quality.  

I was on a super fast WiFi connection, though.
Make sure you're using the new meet. I have found that when I'm talking to my wife if I use the new meet with my Gmail rather than my phone number, the calls are much clearer much less lag
I used a Pixel 9 Pro XL for a month, Used Google Meet for video calls. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. However, during a FaceTime call on my iPhone 16 Pro Max, I noticed a significant improvement in video quality compared to Google Meet on the Pixel 9 Pro XL.
Hi there, I'd recommend you search or post a question on the Google Meet Help Community [here](https://support.google.com/meet/community?hl=en&sjid=6906146183884206152-NC). They can have a look at it.
Google Meet pretty much refuses to use Wifi on your phone. It sucks and the only ""fix"" is to disable mobile data while using it.
It works great for me as long as on a decent connection.  A good alternative is facebook messenger.
It definitely feels like a corporate meeting app and the personal video chat integration kinda feels like an after thought.
I was on 5G earlier and it was very choppy but even when I'm on wifi at home, it's still choppy. I have 1 gig fiber so it's definitely fast enough.
I will have to try this. It usually defaults to the legacy calls. I will try it and hopefully see an improvement. Thanks!
Does the non-legacy also use 720p resolution?
I have 1 gig fiber Internet so I don't think that's the issue. I will continue troubleshooting.
If it helps, what I do is I make sure that I'm making a non-legacy call because when you go into the contacts it'll actually show a little image of the Google meet under their photo
I usually just hit the video button from the Google messages conversation. I just removed my legacy call all together and now it defaults the other way. Haven't tried it to test the quality though.",2025-02-02 23:43:59,6,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1igbatn/google_meet_video_quality/
GooglePixel,Pixel 9 background apps improvement,"At first I was very disappointed with the fact that my P9 was closing background apps very aggressively. It literally couldn't keep 5 apps running at the same time for more than 5 minutes.

However recently I've seen a huge improvement in this aspect. It just seems to keep all of the recent apps in memory, it opens them instantly from where I left off, just like my old phone did. This is just great! I don't know when this happened, I'm on the January  5 Android 15 patch and always install updates as soon as they are available.

Am I crazy or did anyone else experience this huge improvement recently?

Note: I have disabled AI core from day 1 of using the phone.

GooglePixel,Do carrier variants allowed bootloader unlock for pixel 9 pro xl,"Hey everyone,

I recently purchased an ""unlocked"" Pixel 9 Pro XL from Backmarket with the intention of installing GrapheneOS. The phone is still in transit, so I haven't received it yet.

I usually use Samsung devices, so I'm not very familiar with Pixel firmware. My main concern is whether I might receive a network-unlocked carrier variant that doesn't allow bootloader unlocking.

Can anyone confirm if network-unlocked carrier variants allow bootloader unlocking? I’d really appreciate any insights.

From some brief searching in the subreddit, it looks like Verizon variants might be the biggest concern. At&t seem the least concerning. 


Update: I received the phone and it is unlocked. I was able to unlock the bootloader and install Graphene OS without any problems. 

I still have a remaining question though. Is there a way to distinguish between a network unlocked and factory unlocked pixel besides the unlock bootloader toggle?

Coming from Samsung all I had to do was look at the CSC's. For example: XAA/XAA/XAA/ATT means it was a network unlocked AT&T variant with the North America CSC's. 

Comments:
If you get a Verizon, you'll be forever bootloader locked. All the others are okay. 
Like others have said, Verizon are bootloader locked for life. Shame on them for that. If you have the IMEI you can put it into tools online that will tell you what carrier it's with.
Correct. The Verizon models do not allow bootloader unlock even after they are carrier unlocked.
Thank you!!!!
Thank you for your input. The seller did not provide a IMEI number to check. I had to wait for it to arrive. 


I received my phone and luckily it was unlocked and I was able to toggle the unlock bootloader toggle. The IMEI number just indicates it is unlocked. Not sure if that means factory unlocked. Either way I am happy now. Also, I updated my post with that info too. 


Thanks again 😀
Thank you for confirming that!!!",2025-02-02 19:21:33,0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ig55zw/do_carrier_variants_allowed_bootloader_unlock_for/
GooglePixel,Frustrations with Pixel 9,"I have severe mixed feelings about my Pixel 9 that I have for a while now, and I love the feel of the UI and the camera, but everything else is just becoming increasingly frustrating. 

Firstly, is there a bug with notifications? For some reason my notifications from messaging apps like WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram and Messenger are either delayed or they don't ring at all. I'd looked up various solutions online and shut down the adaptive battery functions, double checked the apps notification but they still fail to notify me. I have another spare phone from Poco that gets my notifications almost immediately, and the performance of the Pixel is just embarrassing. What is going on with that? Are there any other solutions about it? 

Secondly, when I'm using WIFI to make video calls or play online games, there always seems to be an issue about connectivity and I'll lag seriously here and there, and my solution is just to switch off WIFI and just proceed with that. It usually solves the problem, but again why is it that other devices wouldn't have this problem? Let's not even go there about the Tensor chip because the performance is quite disappointing in gaming but thankfully I'm only a casual one and don't play demanding games.

Thirdly, with the Reddit app, there seems to be a bug where when I'm scrolled all the way to the top on a subreddit, I'm unable to click on the toolbar that's in the frame with the subreddit header above to search and I have to go back to the main page and search from there. Does anyone else have this issue?

Dang it. The photos of that the Pixel 9 take are awesome, and for the most part it's sufficient for my daily use, but these little things annoy me. There are so many reviewers that rate the Pixel 9 Pro as the best phone of 2024, and I'm wondering if the gap between the two phones are that huge? I don't need the bells and whistles, not the extra lens. But there shouldn't be such a big gap performance-wise right? Seriously considering the Chinese foldable phones on the market...

Comments:
Alot of your issues may be network communications based. Take a look at your home network, do the same problems occur on wireless carrier networks or someone else's WiFi. A family remember recently starting having bissarres issues on their home network I set thier router's DHCP offered DNS from their carrier to Cloudflare's and problems magically disappeared.
About the issue with notifications - it may be the problem with Doze a lot of people are experiencing, which stops notifications after the phone is inactive for some time. There's an ADB command to turn it off (which will turn on after restart) or an app called Doze Stopper. You can try one of these if nothing else helps.
You are not alone. After being away from android for 5 years. I had pixel 3 and 4a. Then moved iPhone. The pixel 9 pro has me drooling. Such a great design and the reviewers were loving it. I frankly am annoyed by it. I have tried all the tips on how to ensure my notifications are not delayed. Earlier today. I was notified 3 hours later that my garage door was left open. The door is set to push notify me at 10 min and 2 hours. Didn't get it for over 3. This happens all the time. Also miss FB messenger messages and calls. I've shut off adaptive connectivity,  adaptive battery, forces the apps to allow in background unrestricted and uninstall and reinstall. No dice. Sure great camera but the day to day stuff a phone should just do it doesn't. 
You have to adjust per app backgrounding and power saving settings to force them on. There's multiple levels of it as well. Performance wise there is almost no difference between the the normal and pro unless you're pushing the processor to it's thermal limits, at which point the 9 will throttle and the Pro with the identical chip will perform slightly better from cooling via heat pipes iirc.
So in terms of your third issue, I think Google doesn't have certain parameters in place for apps to scale to the rounded corners. I noticed a lot of apps have elements that are past the corners or top of the display. And if any app allows you to adjust to display past the top or hole punch area , the top elements seem to act like the notification area and will show them instead of hitting the element. It's so frustrating. I haven't had this kind of issue since the Samsung S9 with the curved display but at least that was more of a physical issue. 


Also they have notes that other users have had issues with elements on the corners and edges of the display (seems to be a software issue that is being worked on
Have you tried running diagnostics? Like to check if you have no hardware manufacturing defects? I have no problems like that at all.
For each of the app you're having issues with notifications press and hold the app icon and go to the app info. Go to the storage option and clear the cache and storage. You're basically reinstalling the app without any previous data. 

My wife and I ran into this issue when we got new phones and restored from backups.  Removing and Reinstalling didn't fix the issue only clearing the old data did it. 

I hope this helps in some way.
I only have that reddit issue on certain communities.
I have a brand new pixel 8. The notification problem is evident, Im going down the same rabbit hole trying to fix it
Check the same issues with safe mode and see if any recent installs are creating it.
Disable battery save mod!
> a bug with notifications


I have heard this a few times and it is yet to happen to me on my 9 pro. I guess I'm just lucky....


I've also never had Wi-Fi problems. 


I don't use the reddit app. 
Thanks for the suggestion. My home network can be wonky at times, but I'd similar experiences in my work place too that it's usually better to disable my WIFI before partaking on a video call or etc.
Thanks, will try that too!
Can you share the ADB command?
I totally hear you my friend. Your last sentence is absolutely it!!! We shouldn't need to jump through hoops to set up a phone to do what it ought to do.
Still doesn't fix delayed notifications. I have set important apps to allow background and set to unrestricted still delayed. It's a POS. 
Thanks, I'll go try that out.
Hope it works out for you my friend!
Did that already!
Agreed did that and still delayed 
Lucky you! Or rather, that's what expected from Pixel 9, ain't it?
Never tried it myself, but I think it's: adb shell dumpsys deviceidle disable
You could consult https://dontkillmyapp.com/
I think it is likely the other way around. You are unlucky as most people don't have these issues.
Thanks! I'ma give it a google. I use WhatsApp as my main way of contact and I'm consistently having problems
I appreciate it. Just annoying to pay a grand for a phone that then needs another app to make it work. 
Indeed 😭😭

GooglePixel,Looking for a Stylish Yet Affordable Case for Pixel 9,"Hi, I'm currently looking for a nice but more affordable case for the Pixel 9, one that doesn't cost 30€ like the original case but still looks similar. Does anyone have a good recommendation for me?

PS: Do you think a screen protector or similar is necessary, or is the glass durable enough on its own?

UPDATE: Just bought the Caseology Nano Pop for 15€ and the Screenprotector from them for 16€. Both are ""Made for Pixel"".

Comments:
It's not a cheap phone so why cheap out on the case? 

Screen protector is worthwhile if you want to avoid micro scratches but again, the cheap ones are junk.
This one is my favorite https://a.co/d/7t29myI
I always buy pitaka Kevlar aramid cases. Light, tough, grippy and slim enough they don't really add bulkiness to your device
Go for durability over style and always use the screen protector.  Unless of course you are super wealthy and can afford to buy a new phone without thinking twice about it.
The original case is so worth the money this year. Feels really premium in hand. 

Honestly the metal buttons alone are worth the difference with the cheaper ones.
Ringke onyx, great quality, looks good with a microdot texture for less than $10
I quite like this one JETech Magnetic Case for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL 2024, Compatible with MagSafe, Translucent Matte Back Shockproof Phone Cover (Black) : Amazon.sg: Electronics https://search.app/1nze1GaGrQ3cJmSk7
I really liked my Torras case on S23, and ordered the Torras 360 stand case for my P9PXL. But this new case was slippery, hard on the hands to hold phone, and the color was underwhelming. I returned that and took a bet with the Caseology plyo with kickstand, even though I was originally not a fan of the transparent case style.

I am really liking this case as it provides a good grip with minimal knurling on the side, and the case shows the phone's color and finish very well. The kickstand is decent enough for my liking and has been functioning well so far.

Only gripe is that the back of the phone captures smudges from fingers quite easily. But that's not a deal breaker for me though.

I would highly recommend this one..
That's the one I have, and I love it.
Not everyone drops their phone. Some people need the case only to make the phone less slippery and to avoid scratches. I've been using cheap Aliexpress cases forever and never even scratched a single device in my life.
Well you have gotten lucky then. I don't think anyone intentionally drops their phones, but you know, accidents do happen, and it is always best practice to be prepared for the worst, especially when you can't afford to replace the broken item.
No, I'm not just lucky. I do every precaution I can - like when I exit my car, I instinctively put a hand in the pocket where my phone is. It's stuff like this.

Also, you should prepare for what you expect to happen, not for the worst case possible. That's what insurance companies are trying to teach you 🤣 I am very happy with my setup, but, please, be my guest. If anything, I would be prone to drop a device in super-bulky, uncomfortable case more often than if I use a simple case from China.
And yet people who also take every precaution still have accidents and their phone gets damaged.  I don't know why you are arguing this silly point. Horray you never had it happen so no one should be prepared for an accident or buy a case that will actually do the job should the worst happen.

GooglePixel,Anyone who doesn't care for Pixel Night time display mode?,"I've been using a Pixel 9 Pro since the release date, I have switched to 9 Pro XL a few weeks back and I was always noticing one thing I couldn't put my finger on. The display just didn't live up to the hype for me, no matter what I did. 

Finally, I noticed it's the night mode. I use it on all my devices with the slider all the way back to the minimal ""orange"" hue. But even with the lowest possible setting, the Pixel screen is way too dim. It's not just about the orange hue (blue light filter), but also overall the screen is very very... just not pretty to look at. 

Anybode else? Or is it just me? In my mind, the iPhone is king of this feature, but it looks like Pixel is just not doing it for me. 

Comments:
I wish night light would increase in intensity over time instead of just 1 setting
I'd die every night if I didn't have that feature.

Night time display + ultra low brightness modes are my go to when it's dark. It's amazing
Yes I have noticed that night light even on its weakest setting, is much stronger than on my previous devices. Even on the very minimum it makes a drastic difference. I wish there was a little bit more subtlety to the adjustments
Maybe I didn't express myself clearly. Yes, those settings work amazing when it's dark. I just set it to kick in after sunset and it just looks horrible while using it normal lighting. I have to crank up the brightness to like 75-80% to be able to see something (auto brightness also starts to struggle after the night mode kicks in) and it still looks bad.

GooglePixel,Pixel 9 Issues with APN - MCC and MNC don't appear & can't connect,"Hello!

I have a GTN mobile SIM Card that requires that I set up an APN manually. However, there are two fields that don't appear in my Pixel 9 phone - MCC and MNC, which seem to be needed to set up the GTN APN. Nevertheless, even without these fields, the APN gets saved and listed, however when I click to select it, it simply doesn't do anything - it just ""ignores"" the selection.

I know this SIM card works and the APN settings are correct, because I've set them up before in my Xiaomi phone and it worked perfectly, so it may be an issue with Pixel 9.

Has anyone faced a similar issue with APNs or has any suggestion on what may be a solution for this? Thanks!

Comments:
Try resetting the Mobile Network settings, and reboot your phone afterwards. And head again to the Mobile Network settings and see if the two fields are available. If that doesn't resolve your issue, I believe it's time to switch to an eSIM. Had the same issue with my old SIM (Méditel, now Orange - Morocco). Made the switch and never looked back.
Thanks! I did that a few times and nothing seemed to work. Also, GTN doesnt seem to have eSIM, which didn't help.
However, I just deleted all other APNs (quite a big list), to the point that there was only GTNs and another that I couldnt delete. And it worked, even without entering the MCC and MNC fields (as they still dont appear). It allowed me to select.

I'm really shocked a purchase so large doesn't require a signature, I ordered a £150 computer off Amazon and was asked to sign and give them a code as proof it was me and delivered safely! Amazon of all companies. 

Usually the company will chase the issue, resend/refund a package and take the original problem up with the delivery company who they assigned to deliver it but Google rarely seem to do that. 

Sorry it's happened that genuinely sucks.

What are FedEx supposed to do? They can't refund you and they can't send a new phone, Google has the money and the devices, are they really expecting you to get refunded by FedEx? Because that's just not how it works
Continue to push back. Remember that the seller contracted the courier, not you, so the failure of the seller's contractor is on them not you. Continue to emphasise that they have not filled their obligation as the seller and it was not delivered.

Could you write back to Google, enclose photos of where a package *would* be delivered to your apartment block, point out that looks nothing like the photo they're using as confirmation of address, enclose FedEx's ticket admiting they don't know where it is?

And seriously, wtf at sending expensive packages without requiring a signature, Google?
If FedEx did an investigation and concluded the package was lost, the tracking information should be updated to reflect that. Also, packages are usually insured. Google should be shipping a replacement or refunding you, then they can recover the loss from FedEx
I have had issues with Pixels I have ordered before. The box showed up and no phone was in the actual packaging. There is a track record with people stealing phones that are delivered. Point this out to them, they know about it.
Wtf, don't they require like some signature of YOU to be able to say ""ok, it's delivered"" ?
Try the following; take a photo of your front door with location tagging enabled, use that photo to have either FedEx/Google compare and say if this isn't resolved to your satisfaction, ask for a valid phone number and physical address for either company as you'll begin taking them to small claims court. FedEx is plenty equipped to see if the driver fucked up and that location tagged photo of your home will definitely help you. (What also helps is a past FedEx tracking number that was successfully delivered to your home)
You're fucked and will have to do a charge back, but you might lose access to your google account.
I had my Pixel Buds pro2 delivered by Fed Ex to the wrong apartments. I ended up breaking into the gated community to retrieve them. F\*\*\* fedex, they NEVER get it right. 

Sorry about your problem, I hope you find a solution.
Have you tried forwarding FedEx's email to Google, so that they can see that FedEx has confirmed that the package is lost? I understand that Google is going by the shipping, and perhaps they think you're lying to them, but if they see it from FedEx directly, that may help? Assuming you haven't tried already, of course––and I apologize if you have.
Do a chargeback on your credit card.
This is where you launch a credit or debit card clawback. Google support is fucking useless.
Sure it wasn't stolen by a porch pirate or the driver?
You gave them the correct address, what address did they say they delivered it to? Did someone sign for the delivery? Go to small claims court.
They did the same thing to my pixel 6 when that released.  I got a notification it was delivered but I didn't hear a truck or see a package at my door so I checked the tracking and it suddenly was changed to a business I had never heard of 2 cities away.  (Up until a few hours before delivery, the address was correct) I called them and they looked into it and told me. ""Yeah so it looks like the delivery address was changed"". I asked how it was changed and if they can see who did it and they just said ""We can't tell, it doesn't say, it just changed.""  Luckily, it was at some business that doubles as an  ""authorized FedEx dropoff/pickup retailer"" I had to drive to pick it up because they wouldn't correct their mistake.  What if it had been delivered to the wrong state or some random house?  Lost faith in them after that experience
File a police report. Submit that to Google as proof so they know you are serious and not scamming them.
1. Do not do a charge back because Google will ban your Google account. 

2. Never order directly from Google. 

It is incredibly frustrating how in this day and age companies refuse to accept any responsibility for anything gone wrong, and will just bounce you between each other. I paid you, right? It is your responsibility to have whatever I paid for delivered to me. Until I receive it, it is on you, not me. My part of the transaction is to pay, it is not my responsibility to chase up on your mistakes.
I know it’s too late and I’m not sure what type of stores are local to you. But please stop ordering through Google store. Had my pixel 6 “lost”  by fedex and took a solid month to get google to fix the issue (refund). Go to a physical store if you can like Best Buy as they generally have the same if not better offers.
The station should be able to ping where the package was delivered to. I work for FedEx and I once misdelivered a package and they looked up the ping my device sent to them when I put it in as delivered and sent me back to grab it because I forgot where I had brought it. Sorry about this I hope you figure it out
Just saying their car has GPS + delivery time should make fedex find the address...
If you paid with a credit card then call them and ask them to charge back. They'll fight for you.
Google are terrible for things like this, a friend ordered a 9 Pro Xl and received an 8 Pro, they kind of sorted it but they gave him a return label with the from address as someone elses name and address, presumably the person who was supposed to get the 8 Pro, but that's a GDPR data breach. In the end it was going to take over a week to sort so he got them to refund and bought somewhere else instead.
Did you pay for this with a credit/charge/debit card?

Dispute the charge, in writing, as soon as possible. This will be just another avenue to follow to make this right for it, in case you never get the phone.

Also, you need to *call* and talk to someone at both companies, not use emails or support pages. Keep pushing them until you get a human on the phone that can help. I think if you're as persistent a pain in the ass as you can be, you'll get some resolution. 

This is the problem today - we use emails and some form on a support page, they say ""case closed"" and many people think that's the end. Call them and keep calling them.

That location looks like Heisenberg's underground meth lab.
This is exactly the reason why OTP for delivery is a mandatory at least in countries like India.
Hey, can you please check your [inbox](https://www.reddit.com/message/inbox/)? I just sent you a private message.
I'm guessing your address is correct on the order and delivery. 
If not it's on you.
If it is (which it probably is) then this is on FedEx.
Not sure how anyone thinks Google should send out another phone, they sent one, it got delivered, the fact it was to the wrong place isn't yours or google's fault if all the details are correct.

FedEx should be footing the bill for this. Otherwise if they just get the sender's to cover FedEx errors then they don't even have to try to send stuff to the correct address...
> I'm really shocked a purchase so large doesn't require a signature,

When I ordered my 8 Pro, I explicitly made sure a signature was required during the order and while tracking the delivery.

Despite that, it was delivered to the wrong house without a signature collected (it was left on a porch as proven by the confirmation photo). Fortunately for me, it was a neighbor a few houses down so I was able to retrieve my phone without issue, but I did make sure to complain to Google about using FedEx and to FedEx about the mishandled delivery. 

That said, my 9 Pro was delivered correctly, with signature, though I still wish I could have selected UPS as an option even if the delivery wouldn't be free.
This is what usually will do it
I have provided all the pictures and they can see it themselves when they track the package. They are blindly going off what the FedEx tracking says ""delivered"" they could careless if it is delivered to me or the driver's friend.
Companies like Google usually self insure, so they wouldn't have purchased insurance beyond the $100 that FedEx includes for free.
FedEx 'delivered' a package of mine with expensive jewelry in it and stated it was signed by 'my name'. I wasn't even home at the time. Luckily, a kind neighbor on another street who must've received the package came and dropped it off in front of my place within the same hour. I was monitoring our cameras and never saw FedEx drop off any package to our residence.
A local FedEx facility manager informed me drivers are supposed to deliver the package to your house door and he informed me the driver who delivered did a mistake and he cannot recollect where he delivered. Package is considered lost, google needs to reship the device. Unfortunately Google support agents are either blind or they are just going off what FedEx tracking says, item delivered. It took Google support 14 days to send me the message.
I wonder if using a burner Gmail account for the store might be a good idea just in case? Seems like theft/misdeliveries happen kinda often and need a charge back.
I provided a FedEx email screenshot and Google response was this - Our records confirm that your order was successfully delivered to the address you provided.

If the shipping address you provided belongs to a company or a non-residential location, please contact them to try to find your package.

Unfortunately, we’re unable to replace your order because Google has delivered your complete order to the location you provided.
This is great advice, as long as you're ready to have your google account and everything attached to it immediately deleted.
Yeah, id take the driver to court, that would help him remember real quick
The shipping address is correct, the FedEx driver delivered to an unknown location and he cannot recollect where he delivered it. From the delivery it shows a water heater but I am unsure.
But only the shipper can request that.
Google contracted with FedEx. If FedEx lost the phone, Google is the only one that can recover the value of the phone from FedEx, not the recipient.
Sometimes companies do let you choose the delivery company but Google aren't that proactive. FedEx has also moved into the UK, not sure when but I've started having packages delivered by them and I'm anxious as fuck now from the American stories haha
Happened to me too, with UPS when I ordered a Galacy tab s9 and my pixel watch. I live in a huge apartment building and the mail room has hundreds of people walk through it every day, my stuff was just left on a coffee table next to a few couches for the tenants and guests to use.

Signature was required and they still just dumped it wherever. I was lucky I was refreshing the delivery status page constantly that day lol
At this point I don't think UPS would of been any better. When I got my iPhone 16 PM delivered by UPS it was supposed to need signature. Lucky for me someone was home to get it. I asked if UPS knocked to get a signature and I was told nope. Family member just saw it outside. Unbelievably lucky it wasn't stolen.
FedEx forged my girlfriend's signature on an expensive package. We have cameras and he never even attempted a delivery.
I feel like the driver sold your phone.
I'd suggest to forward the email, not just a screencap. Anyone can manipulate a screencap, but if they can see that the email *did* come directly from FedEx, it may help.
I always love this response.  So he should just let Google scam him for $1,000 because they're too incompetent to open a claim with the company they contracted with to ship the damn product.
Username does not check out
How does one 'take the driver to court'?
I would talk to FedEx again if I were you. Most of these delivery companies have what they call a geofence. It proves that the package was scanned and delivered at the correct location.  

I've had both Amazon and UPS look for packages that were supposedly delivered successfully, and the geofence was not right.   In both cases the driver had left it at the right house number on the wrong street.
What has Fed Ex responded with, then you need to take action with FedEx. They cannot do "" proof of delivery"" , and wasn't the package signature required?
Maybe OP should suggest that...
It seems its easy to track:
https://www.fedex.com/en-ca/tracking/picture-proof-delivery.html
Agreed. Just defo FedEx should be paying
FedEx also delivers packages in Germany for a while now, fortunately I never had problems. Let's hope it stays that way.
No. Just prepare for Google's petulant retaliation.
>So he should just let Google scam him for $1,000 

Please point out where I said that.
OP said the driver couldn't remember where he dropped it off, meaning they know who the driver is. You threaten to sue him or USPS, unless he can literally retrace their steps.
FedEx manager disconnects my calls and says I have nothing to do with your package. Call shipper. FedEx customer service agent says sorry we cannot do anything, contact the shipper and resolve your lost package concern.
Message from FedEx: 

Thanks for reaching out to us about the support ticket Ref-20197. 

We really did our best investigating for this package to be delivered in a timely manner. The package is still not located. Please coordinate with your shipper to follow their internal process about this issue.

We'll be closing the support ticket now.
If your not the shipper, all you get is a certificate with the tracking status and maybe a picture.
File a dispute with your financial institution
Call a news station and ask for help to investigate where your phone is, escalate the situation!!!
I agree but OP can tell that to the shipper!!
That will result in Google deleting your account.
Which is Google, who are refusing to cooperate.
Under the circumstances, burning that bridge with Google would totally be worth it.  

I think a complaint to the FTC would be appropriate. Google should be investigating this with FedEx.  Not in good faith by either Google or FedEx in any sense of the word..

Check all apps that have the Display over other apps permission.

If you don't find it, reboot in safe mode. If it still happens she got a proper adware and you must factory reset.

Also please educate her about online safety.
She probably installed a cleaning app that just fills your phone with ads.
Not Pixel issue, wither try to pinpoint which app is doing it or just reset the phone.
As mentioned, it'll almost certainly be something that's been installed causing it. You may have to delete the most recent apps working backwards until you find the culprit.
factory reset

Probably from an app.
Sounds like malware.
Delete all apps that aren’t the standard ones everyone has
Then just uninstall the app, factory reset will lose everything.

I do not mind some tools, like Play Services, Google Messages, YouTube, and Gmail Client on the device, but I don't find use in Gemini, Photos, Chrome, and Google Password Manager (all as examples). How far can I de-Google a Pixel device without installing something like Graphene and Lineage?

Comments:
You can disable Chrome & Photos. You can fully uninstall Gemini. Password manager just choose to not use it. I
Overcomplicating it, just disable and don't use the apps and install the alternatives you want. If you want to use assistant over Gemini you'll get an annoying popup but otherwise assistant can just be disabled altogether as well.
Disable apps, or you can use universal android debloater.

GrapheneOS and LineageOS serve different purposes that are mostly unrelated, and for specific reasons.
I've never heard of anyone discuss a popup before when choosing another assistant before, what does it look like (if you can show me). Considering that a lot of the phone's features rely on Gemini, how much productivity is impacted for disabling Gemini?
You get a 'try Gemini' card when you open Google assistant and it comes back even if you say no. It doesn't get in the way it's just annoying",2025-02-01 18:27:36,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ifcrqx/degoogle_my_pixel_without_graphene/
GooglePixel,Pixel 9 camera preview different from stored photo,"Hello, as per title I'm having this issue. When I do frame a subject prior taking a pic, I really enjoy the preview, then I shot the pic, I go into gallery and the pic at the beginning match with the preview but in seconds it changes.

[Here a lil screen recording](https://imgur.com/a/IexPxnV) to show this weird behaviour. Is there a way to avoid this? Often I enjoy more the preview then the actual saved pic.

Comments:
The preview doesn't show any HDR processing, the final photo does.

You can disable Ultra HDR in the camera settings which is the extra brightness map, but the rest of the processing is just part of the design.
If you use another camera app you can cut out the heavy handed processing that most stock camera apps use.
I've disabled but it does the same the stuff shown in the vid. what do you mean with ""the rest of processing is just part of the design""?
>The preview doesn't show any HDR processing, the final photo does.

Not that really relevant here, but just so you know, that's a common misconception. Even the preview uses HDR processing, introduced as Live HDR+ on the Pixel 4. This processing tries to get close to the final result, but guesses a lot more to be able to run in real time.
any suggestion?
Every camera has post processing that gets applied to the photo after you take it. One of those processes is HDR where the camera takes multiple shots very quickly but all at different exposures, then blends them together to show more detail in dark and bright areas. Even with Ultra HDR disabled this still occurs.
ProShot, Open Camera, Gcam mods, plenty out there, try them out to see what suits.
Try Instagram
so there's no way to disable it :(

Are others seeing this issue? Is there a fix?

Comments:
I want to blame the iPhone for it considering Android group chats don't have this issue. And the fact that they are very new to RCS. The problem is that it's very difficult to get an android only group chat lol.
I have seen it on occasion and not sure why. I just start another stream with the same people and it seems to take care of it
iPhones are struggling with iOS.. especially ones on early iOS 18 builds
Apple's RCS implementation is garbage.
One solution I heard of is to create a ""new group"" in which the iPhone users have all their previous messages deleted.
Are any of them using the Mac client for their texting? 

I'm the sole android user in a 6+ person group chat and the only time it breaks off a new thread at this point is when one person, the same person every time, replies via the Mac client. 

We had one person in the group say they were convinced that was the issue to the point they stopped using it and it hasn't been an issue with them since. 

The one stubborn one though, keeps breaking things and doesn't care.
Yes this has been happening since day 1 of ios18 release. Haven't figured out exactly what causes it (I think it's multiple things), but one that I'm pretty sure causes it is when someone changes the group name or theme on iphone.
Unfortunately, you are likely experiencing this issue because the initial version of RCS on iOS was built to an early RCS design specification. The best path forward would be for the iPhone users to contact Apple or the carrier to provide feedback about the issue.
Near impossible where I live to get an Android only group chat lol
My work group chat has 8 people. One time one of my coworkers said 'you know you are the reason all of our chats are green??""

Where did the option go for it to automatically ring my phone or see it on a map?

I know my phone isn't 24 miles away, even hours after finding my phone it still says it's 24 miles away.. when I can see it 6 inches away from me..

I'm not understanding, it shows a list of devices your account is logged into and then you select the device and the map should appear after that. This is for my Pixel 8 Pro, for other devices it didn't show a map but I can see when I last used them or when they last synced.
Yup, find my device is still a thing.  Your device will record it's location while it has power.
Login to your Google account and select the mobile from the device list (edit: under security). This brings up the map and a few options on the left pane like locate the mobile, ring it and wipe it. It'll prompt you to enter the mobile screen pin/pass to verify ownership.

Hi there, could you try resetting the app preferences on your Pixel device and check if that helps?

Go to Settings > System > Reset options > Reset app preferences.

Note: This will reset all of your app preferences to their default values. It won't remove any app data

Additionally, try rebooting your phone into [safe mode](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2852139) and see if that resolves the issue. If it works fine in safe mode, it means a 3rd party app is causing the issue. Temporarily remove them one by one, starting with the most recent until you find the cause.
Notifications volume is separate from other volume so make sure it is turned up. Also make sure you have a notification default sound selected.
Go into app settings. Make sure notifications are enabled. Happened to me by accident when I was playing around with the sound settings and tweaking

It's hard to go wrong with any of the big 3 right now.   Samsung s series phones take great pics, iPhones take great pics, and so do the pixels.  

Pixels do some cool camera tricks 
Samsung s ultra phones have crazy zooms on their cams
iPhones are good with video stabilization

Honestly you can choose any and it'll look good on Instagram.
Generally all Androids including the Pixels doesn't have the same optimized upload quality as with the iOS app, unfortunately. 

I used both iPhone 16 PM & 9 Pro XL for my IG works and iOS still uploads at higher resolution.

because messengers add their own compression to the file you trying to share to make the file weight less in megabytes. it's not the pixel problem. it's not a problem of any phone tbh.
Just done some tests, seems good on Instagram, not as good on Snapchat

Same when you send images on Telegram, they literally go pixelated, I tried to lower the camera to 12mb and send, same issue. Whereas iPhone still sends higher quality pictures overall 

“ this is from a personal experience on Telegram only “
as you wish
Not true, chose the high quality by sending as a file instead of a picture

Yes, this is what I do now. What is not true exactly? 

Try to send the same photo from gallery from Pixel and iPhone and see the difference. Massive difference between the two. 

If I want to send it in full size I would send it as a file and it will be saved as a file in the chat, not as a photo.
If you say so.
Be happy with that wrong information.
Again, that's not true.
I have both and the compression is exactly the same.
It's embedded inside the app not the system
Just to be clear: 

Sending a picture directly from the gallery 
iPhone: not full quality image, but decent one
Pixel: it will be sent with very bad quality, you can see the pixels as soon as you zoom in. 

Sending the picture as a file: both will send the image with full quality no doubt. But the picture will be saved as a file in the chat, not as photo or media. So if you open the chat media, you will not find the picture with the media( if you sent it as a file) instead, you will find it with the files in the chat.
Again, not true, if you chose the gallery to send a picture, it's exactly the same compression.

I've made the test with the exact same file and they have the same size and quality.

If you take a picture inside the app, you'll see a difference.",2025-02-01 01:09:23,6,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ieuqfi/pixel_9_pro_ig_quality/
GooglePixel,My wife got a Pixel 9 Pro XL,"... But isn't on Reddit. So my question is: what are the ""go to"" tools she need to know about and what tricks are there to improve the battery life and the visual effects on that phone? 

I got myself an S24U and in the Samsung world you got Goodlook to restyle and refuncion some of the software. Is there something similar for the pixel series? 

Thank for all you're tips :) 

Comments:
Use the Pixel Tips app. After a week or two, run through it again if she skipped anything to see if she's now interested.

Battery life, not a lot you can do. It's actually pretty good, but just know certain apps, *especially* Instagram, do not respect the disabling of ""Allow background usage"".

Visual effects, also nothing, just have her go into Display settings and make sure Screen Resolution is set to Full and Smooth display is on.

Otherwise, enjoy, it's a fantastic phone.
For excellent battery life, uninstall TikTok, Facebook, Reddit, YouTube and Instagram.
Out of the box the resolution or refresh rate wasn't set to the highest. I can't remember which. I would change that because the battery life is fine with it at max.
Also remember with the battery life it will improve over a couple of weeks once the phone learns her habits and use. So be patient on the battery side. Battery life on my P9P is really solid compared to my P7.
"" Clear Calling "" definitely should be enabled.
Pixel UI comes as is
To generalise - she probably doesn't give a fuck.  I mean it's you that's asking - not her.

Me and my partner both have Pro XL's and she's absolutely not interested when I tell her there's a security update or Zoom Enhance is enabled.
For me the lack of builtin features and customizability is why it was a 50/50 for between the pixel 9 pro and the S25. And I still do not know if I made the right choice. I chose the Pixel 9 pro only for its cameras in the not extremely big phone class.

Now that said apps which you can buy or let sell your data can do a lot. At least from what I read online.
A different launcher maybe? Nova is a popular choice.
Custom ROMs run so well on Pixel phones with a lot of customizations.
To increase battery life turn phone to off.
You will find Samsung OneUI is more customizable than the PixelUI. 

I was on iOS from 2007 - 2016. Then I went to an S8+ through an S10+ and in 2022 bought a Pixel 6 Pro. The transition to the Pixel led me to Niagara Launcher. I highly encourage checking it out. Very minimal. Very clean. Some excellent features like app stacking. 

Pair up Niagara with KWGT for a custom widget.
> ""...improve the battery life and the visual effects...""

Really?
Go to Camera settings and turn off ""Save Selfie as Previewed"" unless you think it's cool to have all words written backwards in your photos or to appear that you are driving from the passenger seat.
Toggle on the Adaptive Battery setting. Turn on Dark Theme. Turn off smooth display. Toggle off Always show Time and Info.
Instagram respects it fine for me, but some others no, *looking at you, outlook*
I would turn on the adaptive charging limit to 80% if the way they use their phone supports that. If you keep your battery between 20 and 80 it'll last significantly longer in terms of active battery wear reduction.

Also go through every apps privacy settings as well as in the system settings.
So then I have a brick, awesome. /s
TikTok and Facebook I could easily live without.
Kidding or not, I did this with my Red magic 9 pro XL and just use the browser. We forget that these services work there but I do find it annoying for certain websites how they'll pop up this ""Get the app"". But most of the time 1 ""No"" is enough to not see it again. For YouTube background play, we can use Firefox and get the YouTube background playback extension. There's also YouTube music if it's for music tho. 

I'm planning to go Pixel for the first time. The red has a nice 6500 mah battery but dust get in because of the fan and also not being dust proof and water resistant.  I think games will run as smoothly but in the last year I kinda stopped playing heavy games.  I could still use it for games and use the Pixel for everyday use with amazing pictures.  I'm wondering if I should wait for the Pixel 10 which will run on their chip and on a 3nm architecture. Rumors have started to come out. 

Anyways, I'll see.
Resolution is set to the lower option by default.
Yeah even going from the Pixel 8 Pro to the Pixel 9 Pro XL, I have noticed a decent improvement in battery life. The Pixel 8 Pro battery life was decent though and was better in some ways
This can lower the audible volume of the person that's calling, ironically making it more difficult to understand them
My wife is the same. I put her always used apps on her Home Screen a year ago and she hasn’t added anything.  If she needs something she asks Gemini or more likely just swipes up and picks what she needs alphabetically. She doesn’t even change the background.  But she raves about her Pixel 8 to everyone and loves it.  She is happy as a clam scrolling Instagram and snapping pics of our grandkids. She LOVES the camera.
Imo you made the way better choice going with the P9P. Much better cameras and UI and experience overall
Nova just makes it look like Android from like 8 years ago
Which one are you using?
This is why I use nova launcher. Customizable to the Nth degree!
But then what is the point in paying for a premium product, and then disabling 'quality of life' features?
I think Instagram is the only app I've ever noticed with high background usage while restricted. I wish Google would crack down on this kind of thing.
And a life! 
Anyway, I'm kidding.
Tiktok is brain cancer for those who are ADHD or ADD even worse if you're on the spectrum.  Sometimes it would hypnotize me and repeat repeat repeat and then I'm like okay time to delete this BS I'm losing brain cells. Lol
Any idea why?
I don’t see that at all. Clear calling is wonderful on my wife’s pixel 8 and my 9 pro. Never have to turn up the volume and you don’t have to shout in the car. Clear as a bell on both ends
Perhaps a little bit. If both parties are on Wi-Fi calling, It sounds like a crystal clear call.
I realized this first week that it is very personal. My S10 could effectively use lenses to get things very sharp close by or zoom. Notices the Pixel lenses cannot. Video autofocus was better on the S10. S10 had auto burst. 

Pixel pro has 50mp photo's and 5x zoom. Great for planespotting and photographing animals.

Software wise One UI often hit just right with the options. I could get aod to only show charging status till fully charged when charging. I could get small pill shaped notifications that did not wake the screen any further. Also I had a clean homescreen. One screen with saved links and a nicely orderned app drawer with all kinds of folders. I do miss having these options without installing 3rd party apps which do only part of those things.

So for me it really is just about the camera. And the other things I will just have to get used to.
I wouldn't go that far, but the point is, you have options with nova. Don't like the persistent Google search bar? Remove it. Want more rows or columns in you home screen? Done.
GrapheneOS it is.

Gives the impression of longer battery life",2025-01-31 21:15:14,53,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1iepjqh/my_wife_got_a_pixel_9_pro_xl/
GooglePixel,Long Post Ahead – My Honest and Complete Experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL as a Longtime iPhone User,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my full and honest experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).

# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XL

I usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn’t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max—at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.

# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The Camera

I’m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I’ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions—especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I’ve made a separate post about this issue).

# Software Experience: Just ""Good,"" But Not Exceptional

The Android experience on the Pixel is fine—it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.

Some features I really liked:

* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.
* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.
* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.

# Fingerprint and Face Unlock

* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.
* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don’t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.

# Camera: My Biggest Disappointment

Despite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.

# Issues I Faced:

1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** – Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.
2. **Depth of field issues** – The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can’t fully correct it.
3. **Limitations on third-party apps** – 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.
4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** – When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.
5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** – It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.
6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** – The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.
7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** – Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.

Most of these issues weren’t present on my iPhone, even though I’ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.

# App Store & Software Ecosystem

I also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent—many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.

# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily Use

I want to be clear: I’m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I’ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn’t lived up to my expectations.

I’m genuinely wondering:

* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?
* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?
* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?

I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I’d love to hear your thoughts and input—especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I’m overlooking?**



\*Edit 1 : More context 

I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the **Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding **RAW photo processing**.

I’ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in **Lightroom**—they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos. There’s a **huge loss of detail, aggressive noise reduction, and softening**, making the RAW files almost unusable for proper editing.

I’ve attached **two images of the same RAW file** to show what I mean:

📸 **Comparison Images**:  
[https://imgur.com/a/BdOOOty](https://imgur.com/a/BdOOOty)

1️⃣ **First image** → RAW viewed in Google Photos (looks relatively fine).  
2️⃣ **Second image** → The exact same RAW file opened in Lightroom (before any edits).

# The Issue:

* When opening the RAW file in **Lightroom**, it looks **significantly worse**, with **excessive smoothing and loss of sharpness**.
* This happens **before applying any adjustments**, so it’s not an issue with my editing.
* It feels like **Google is still applying some kind of processing or compression to RAW files**, which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW in the first place.

# Questions:

* **Is this a known issue with Pixel RAW processing?**
* **Is there a way to get true, unprocessed RAW files for editing?**
* **Anyone else experiencing this with Lightroom or other editing apps?**

I’d really appreciate any input from other Pixel users, especially photographers. I want to get the most out of this camera, but this has been a frustrating limitation. Let me know if you have any insights!

  


Comments:
You're critiques are valid. I don't see any fanboy takes. Simply ur saying  the app quality/experience is lesser.  The Pixel camera praise is overblown because people disregard video recording when it comes to camera, and they're shocked when it doesn't win a overall camera award.

I still think it's photos are the best but photos are 1/2 of the camera for me.

At least you're giving it a shot. If you want to see something crazy. Open a clip from Twitter on both phones. I bet the iPhone will play is in higher resolution. You are coming from a polished premium phone so the bar is set high.

I think Pixel is good enough, just not for $1199+. Imagine comparing a 16 pro max vs a Pixel 7 pro or 8 pro. 

Your newer pixel should blow the 14 pro max out of the water. And I wish Pixel reads posts like this for actual improvement. Dismissing this as fanboy post doesn't help the phone, actually makes it worse.
**""Limitations on third-party apps** – 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.""

The 8k is fake. It's a 4k shot upsampled to 8k on Google's servers , and downloaded back to your phoen after. The sensor is 8k capable, but the Tensor G4 ISP limits capture to 4k. So technically, only 4k is available to ANY app, including Pixel camera. 

On a side note, you keep mentioning ""professional"". I don't disagree with the lens switching crapfest, but who uses a phone for professional work? Wouldn't you have a dedicated camera for any real professional photography work? Why bother shooting with  a phone if you're going to upload RAW images to Lightroom? Just use an actual camera that can shoot proper RAW files.
I came from an iPhone 13 and the photos are in a different league on the pixel. I got rid of my Cannon camera they are so good. Not sure what you are doing wrong.  I find it best to just point and shoot and let the AI do the work. The 50 MP is great but I usually don't use it since the photos take so much space. People rave aboutthe pics when I show them or send them.   Face ID i agree is not as good as iPhone but it's about 95% and when it doesn't work I just use my thumb. 
Operating system is worlds better and I definitely think apps are cheaper but most are free.
Much better screen at 120 Hz. I can't even look at my old screen it is so jittery
SPAM CALL SCREENING!  all my spam calls disappeared on the Pixel
Crystal clear call quality and noise cancelling during calls on the Pixel and I can use it on wifi without everyone breaking up like on iPhone. 
Everything is cheaper - watches tablets everything including the phones with Android and you get the Samsung ecosystem also.
The reality is phones are all pretty awesome these days so everything is an opinion, but my opinion is I won't go back to that walled in crappy apple ever. Period. So much happier and probably going to pick up a OnePlus open 2 when it launches as an added phone.
Great analysis, and I share the exact same feedback coming from Samsung, which is what I would recommend to facilitate a smooth transition from Apple to Android.
My only comment is that I can't fathom why anyone would want to shoot 8K video on their phone.
I have the P9Pro and my wife has the IP16pro. Neither of us are professionals but we just went on a two week trip and took similar photos/videos under similar conditions so we were able to do some fairly good comparisons. We enjoy the photos out of my pixel more and the video out of her iPhone more.

After handling both devices, I would say the pixel is overall much nicer and easier to use from the keyboard to notification control to volume settings. The iPhone seems to overcomplicate certain things (so many functions require 1-2 extra clicks) and the lack of a universal back button/gesture seems like a massive oversight.
I definitely think the auto processing overcooks it on the photos a lot of the time, especially when taking photos of people (I think it defaults to Instagram ready) but it does take some awesome photos. I've found the low light capabilities of the pixel to be superb, so I wonder if yours is just faulty.
Made the same switch for the same reason. Very disappointed with the Pixel 9 Pro. 

I've been alternating between google devices and apple for years.
MotionCam allows you to RAW video/photo capture directly from the sensor. You can try with the free version before buying the pro one
I had both of them and I love the pixel. Android is these days much better than iOS (I had every single iPhone in the market since the 3G). I used to be such a fan boy but these are the things than loved in the pixel:
- the screen looks better to me than the iPhone 16pM
- The gboard is ages ahead of iOS one 
- I love the android notifications they are really useful much better than iOS ones. 
- I love the fact you have an historic of your notifications. 
- Spam filters, that’s so f***** good 
- Call screening 
- I love Gemini and other AI features like magic eraser (wonderful when trying to take a picture in front of a crowded monument)
- the UI looks fresh and modern to me compared to IOs (maybe I have been using iOS too long). 

For the record, I switched from an iPhone 15PM to the pixel 9 pro XL but finally I sold it and went back to an iPhone 16pm, that was a huge mistake and I’m missing my Pixel so much. 

I always had iPhone, since the 3g, replacing it every year, but since the iPhone 13pm I have the feeling that nothing changed, iOS is getting old fashioned, not innovative at all and charging a fortune.
[deleted]
Funny, I'm a pixel user that WANTS to switch to iPhone, but I just can't stand the iPhone software (I have a work iPhone that I use daily, so I have given it a fair shake. I just hate it).

I don't actually disagree with much of what you're saying here, especially the crummy app experience on the play store. I am surprised you're having problems with the camera in low light though. I have a pixel 6 and I'm still regularly impressed with the low light shots.
Comparing Pixel photos with an iPhone 14 pro max, Pixel is leagues ahead buddy. Watch any MKBHD blind test since past few years.

Stick to the stock camera. Not sure why you're using 3rd party apps which may not be well optimised for Android and then complaining. Pixel has all the Pro camera settings you may need. If you still need more, then just use your DSLR.
Face Unlock slow? Unreliable? Just the opposite here. There are times I don't want to unlock so I can use the Find a Song thing...Crazy how easy and fast it unlocks via face. Tried a rescan?
Thanks for the detailed write up. I think most lay-people who enjoy the pixel camera (myself included) like the ""pixel aesthetic"" that comes with the images; however, i can see how that would be frustrating for a professional. I am under no illusion that the photos I am taking are not a significant product of software processing; however, I highly doubt I could do better with manual controls and would basically never consider processing a photo in lightroom or similar.

I'm sure many would be interested for you to post photos taken from your camera and different devices so you could show us what a trained eye sees in the images and workflow.
I’ll just say that cell phone camera photos are invariably crap.  I was going through some old photos on my computer and went back about 15 years and saw some I had taken with a canon power shot point and shoot.  📸. Tiny slim camera where you tie it on and the lens comes out.  Small lcd on the back.  Very slim.  Those photos looked “professional” compared to my phone 16pro max.  Not a large sensor either back then one of the smallest they’d put in point and shoots.
I can't personally speak for the low light performance as I don't really use my camera all that much at night. I know with a lot of the devices I have used though it always looks very artificial. Apple typically goes for a much more natural look so I'm not surprised that their low light performance is better. I know for daylight photos I find the camera to be very good. 

The software, to each their own with regards to what you like. There's things I wish Google would change, but overall I enjoy how fluid the UI is. I prefer the control center that Samsung or Apple have with regards to more options not less. Google really locked themselves in with the Android 12 control center and it will always drive me nuts that you don't have a cellular and WiFi toggle separate anymore.
Have you switched from RGB to P3? I found my pixel raw to be harder to work with, yes, but the point and shoot default auto camera is perfect for me. It captures perfectly the details without oversharpening or overblowing highlights like Samsung does, or yellow tinting like iphone does. The only things for me that the iphone does better  are video and portrait photos.
Camera concerns are valid. The camera can be quite inconsistent. Sometimes you'll get a solid 9/10 quality shot and other times it looks like you took the shot with a phone from the early 2000's. Also taking multiple shots in quick succession can slow the phone down significantly. 
I find pixel cameras to be very good, in fact better than my iPhone. The thing I don’t like about pixel cameras is the post processing, if I got what I saw on the display ( like my iPhone and older pixels ) the images would be absolutely fabulous! I never use portrait mode, not even on my iPhone, simply because it’s rubbish on any phone . I like the simplicity of Google pixels , androids version of iOS
Good write up thanks.

I'm not a pro but a prosumer, love taking family pictures with my Sony A7 IV + Tamron 35-150 f2.0-f2.8 and Sony GM 35mm f1.4, always in manual mode, my friends think I'm crazy but then blown up with the results. All phone pictures are garbage next to this kit, and for challenging light LR + DxO PureRaw, amazing.

Like you said, I don't always have the Sony FF camera with me so I want the best possible camera phone (while not being an iPhone), but also a very good phone experience, I'm debating the P9P vs the S25U (have ruled out the S25+ because of the mediocre cameras). The new Samsung camera app that has launched with the S25 series looks very good, lots of manual control, color tweaking etc.

The 6.3"" P9P looks like a very compelling package but I'm gravitating towards the S25U for added versatility, top of the line CPU, etc. Wish it was more compact. Price is similar for both with Samsung launch discounts.
I think for your needs and wants a Samsung s25 Ultra would have suited you better. I honestly think the pixel line is becoming very overrated... For me I'd take a OnePlus 13 any day over the pixel.
I’ve got a pixel 8 pro and had an iPhone 14 PM and had similar issues. I still have my 8 pro but back on a 16 PM as my daily driver. On my 8 pro face unlock is rubbish and finger print sensor only works 30% of the time and I tried for a year. 

If I try android again it’d be a Samsung, which I enjoyed when I had the note.
Wow very interesting read , I have a 15 pro max and wanted the pixel 9 pro as a secondary phone as I almost always prefer its photos plus wanted to try Android again…was not expecting the pixel to be inferior I did read that the latest camera update and Android 15 messed up the camera, maybe that’s the issue? It’s very hard for me to move from the iPhone because of Apple TV , MacBook, AirPods and Apple Watch…
I have a pixel 7 pro and am looking to upgrade this year. I do find quite a few of the images to be over processed and over-sharpened to my taste at least. Dropping the exposure slightly and lowering shadows in Lightroom helps to give an image which aligns more with what I get from my Sony cameras though. Every once in a while in Ideal conditions it produces simply stunning images. The biggest criticism is that from the 48mp sensor  it creates these tiny JPEGs that look ok on the phone but break down on a 4K monitor especially if cropped. Processing the raw files often helps  but requires a lot of input on my part. Hoping that this year’s pixel 10 pro fixes some of these issues for me and I can leave my Sony behind in more demanding conditions while travelling.
It seems like iPhone and Samsung have caught up and even overtaken the pixel in the camera department especially in low light photos (indoor etc). But only by a very small margin.

I have watched many comparisons and overall the pixel tends to fall behind the iPhone 16 pro max and s25 ultra.

It really depends on personal preference at this point. 

I am a huge pixel fan and can’t wait for a snapdragon pixel I get the feeling the tensor chips are bottlenecking the pixels full capabilities.
Yeah as an amateur photographer the current Pixel automatic enhancement of the photos is not great.
That being said I set mine to jpg + raw so for those shots I really want I can get the raw and use that. It's better but not perfect.
It's basically the same camera in the phone for about 3 years now. Pixel 4 - 6 had the best camera on the market. I'm still using my P7 Pro and it takes amazing photos in most conditions, but I don't confuse a high-end portable consumer grade camera with a professional dslr. The P7P is basically the same camera configuration as the P9XL.

The AI is there for a reason - use it.
No tldr??
Many people here are amateur (like me), can you share some pics or some links to comparatives, so we can see the differences that you already said.

Note: in my case, I love so much the pixel camera, is the better camera in a phone that I saw. But I'm an amateur, I'm not a professional 😅
“I still use my iPhone as my primary device…”  full stop right here. your review is useless. 

You didn’t live with or use a pixel. This is t a complete experience. You complained and compared it to your main device. 

Sell your iphone, switch to google services and only use a pixel for 6 months then you will be able to actually give an “honest and complete review.”
Damn...sounds like you should go back to iPhone and let us enjoy our Google Pixels.

oh ok I see, make more since now, still not sure why it is applied on the 50Mb camera as well, unless if I'm only trying apps not supporting more than 12Mb, share some apps if you have good ones. Still using the default camera app till now. 

""On a side note, you keep mentioning ""professional"". I don't disagree with the lens switching crapfest, but who uses a phone for professional work?

I use A7cr for my professional work if I want to shoot professionally, My main point is that I want something I can carry around with me all the time, easy to capture and edit. Carrying Full size camera all the time is nonsense. Also, I'm trying to switch from Iphone since Apple has been very bad with their upgrades lately, 3 years of the same phone, so it was an opportunity to try something new, to change from Iphone to Pixel
I envy you that you got very pleasant experience, I'm trying the same, I was expecting many people will feel attacked when I post, but my post mainly is to understand more if I'm missing anything, not to attack anyone or compare a phone to another. I wish my experience was better than what I had till now, but I might be doing something wrong.
The thing with Android devices being cheaper on average is that their resale value makes up for the difference in price points. Iphones and iOS devices hold value better.
I only use video boost for concert clips since it works the best that way for me. Everything else is 4k, or even 1080P
I don't TBH, my iPhone 14PM has only 4k so I was curious to try out 8K, I don't notice any major difference
I fully agree, That’s why I highlighted that videos are overrated on Pixel, still much better on iPhone. For casual and daily photos, Pixel is more than enough for 95% of users. Adding to your point, the double click to open the camera on the pixel insanely underrated. I miss it every time I use my iPhone
That’s exactly why I bought the Pixel in the first place. Year to year iPhone updates are becoming very minimal. i agree with most these points which I overlooked or I just took at as a normal thing for Pixel users.
I've found that changing the image's color profile in Lightroom to ""Adobe Standard"" or ""Adobe Color"" helps remove some of the weird raw processing. It's the first thing I do after I import any of my RAW files. Hope that helps.
Can you please share RAW source of this photo?
MKBHD’s blind tests were actually one of the reasons I got excited about the Pixel and decided to buy it. But if you watch closely, he always **emphasizes the lighting conditions**—most of the shots in his tests are taken in **good lighting**, which is exactly what I mentioned in my post. In **good lighting, the Pixel performs amazingly well**, but once the lighting **drops even slightly**, that’s when the issues start showing up.

Also, I **am** using the stock camera app—I never said I wasn’t. But since Android is marketed as a more **open and flexible** system compared to iOS, I expected better third-party app support. On iPhone, third-party apps like Halide can **fully utilize the camera hardware**, while on the Pixel, they’re **artificially restricted** to lower resolutions and video quality. That’s disappointing for a platform that’s supposed to offer more freedom.

Even within the **stock app**, many pro features are missing or feel more like quick toggles rather than full controls. And even with RAW, the processing **still applies excessive noise reduction and softens details**, which is frustrating.

I want to be clear—this **isn’t an attack** on the Pixel. If anything, I really **want** to use it more and make it my main phone. But these issues are real, and I was hoping there might be a way to override some of them. If there’s a workaround or something I missed, I’d love to hear it!
The Pixel's face unlock, like many other traditional camera-based unlocks, performs poorly in lowlight/dark conditions. The iPhone's Infrared dot projector/flood illuminator unlock module circumvents these conditions for the face, and makes Pixels/other Android devices pale in regards to unlocking in this manner.
I remember I was thinking about doing rescan, I don’t remember wither I did or not, I will try now!
My 8a's face unlock is instant!
Even after three months, I still wants to enjoy it as my daily driver. I was under the impression that I would get real raw images similar to what I get from my Sony’s camera ( I know huge differences) but on a daily driver phone. What I’m facing are some technical issues which I have already edited to the post to add more context of what I mean and the issue I’m facing from a phone that I believe targeted towards a daily and on the go photographers with more options and expanded raw editing
I use the phone camera for day to day photography, taking quick pictures for social media or taking videos for family memories. They are improved nowadays, so as DSLR’s
Thanks for sharing your setup and perspective. 
I also shoot with a Sony camera and absolutely understand where you’re coming from. After switching to the Pixel for my phone shots, I decided to upgrade my main camera to the A7CR paired with a 35mm f1.8 lens. 

The combo has been a game changer—61 megapixels give me incredible detail, and the compact size means I can bring it everywhere for daily shooting. On top of that, I’ve been amazed by the video quality in S-Log and the ability to record in 4:2:2. It’s a crazy-good combo that makes the best out of both worlds!
I wouldn't. Every single photo I've seen from a OP13 has been terrible. Also not paying flagship prices for the company that used to be a flagship killer brand.
Try to use Adobe colors profile on Lightroom when importing RAW images
Do you see any differences when you see the RAW file on Photos compared to when you open it on Lightroom? Mines immediately turn into very soft image once I open it on Lightroom so I have to crank up the sharpness very high
Not sure how to attach photos in reply but I can share you some on the dm. Not for my professional work, but for the RAW issue I have with my phone
You forgot to read the full title. I’m literally sharing my experience as an iPhone user. You need a ground base to compare to & expectations vs your experience. The title says it exactly.
As a P9PXL user here, their critiques are spot on. I'm sure all other actual pixel users can agree as well, and concede, that there are even more areas that need attention and improvement
I’m not trying to attack any one, I’m just sharing an honest opinion and trying to see what are these technical issues I’m facing and how can I overcome them to enjoy the Pixel experience as everyone else
Fanboys ruin the very thing they purport to support. These critiques are entirely valid and representative of the lack of care that Google has with basic functions
BTW to quote someone you can type >text to quote with the greater than sign instead of using actual quotes

>Like this
I did not feel attacked at all. It is great that we have choices and especially with photos, we all have preferences.  Thanks for sharing.
You aren't missing anything.  You can go watch any camera comparison video of the Pixel, iPhone and OnePlus or Samsung on YouTube and you will routinely see the Pixel over processing, the blowing out of shadows, the terrible low light performance usually accompanied by weird red hues and the dull and washed out look Pixel applies to photos a lot of the time, especially compared to the competition.

I don't even need to link examples because any example you choose on YouTube where they are comparing the Pixel to competitors will show this.  The Pixel CAN take great shots, it's just that much of the time it takes shots devoid of life, which look terrible, have terrible edge processing in portrait mode, or which are so full of noise.  This subreddit will try and glaze the Pixel like its 5 or 6 years ago and the Pixel is leagues ahead of the competition, because many of these people have only ever known Pixels so they have no basis of comparison except to other Pixels.
From some reviews/comparisons I watched, the iphone retains more detail but the Pixel outputs a more pleasing image. I would say that is our experience as well. Colour rendering on the P9Pro seems more accurate to nature. We took plenty of sunrise/sunset shots where the Pixel nailed the colours while the IP16Pro completely botched the colours (too desaturated and/or over compensated the colour correction).

> the double click to open the camera on the pixel insanely underrated. I miss it every time I use my iPhone

The IP16 has the extra button that can be configured to open the camera! The button itself is pretty bad though - it's far too difficult to click to take a photo but way too easy to change settings via its touch-capabilities.
Yes! Exactly. I was just reading another post about someone who had the same issue and of the replies explained this to them. I was just playing with the scroller of the profile on LR, turned all the way to 0, very big different. Still showing less sharpness than JPG but maybe because JPG already sharpened. 

Thanks!
I have already added them to the post, same photo opened on both apps, no edit on both, check the edit I added to the post
I've got the 16 pro max and P9pxl with me right now and have been comparing them for a day the iPhone feels more premium and photos are more consistent. The Pixels camera keeps having random adjustments to warm or cold tones and it's really hard to get a good picture. Portraits etc are way better on the iPhone and I never had an iPhone since 2009.

What's confusing me though is pixel 9pxl is only 800 while the 16pm is 1300.
There is a good video showcasing what you are talking about on YouTube, comparing the iPhone and the Pixel and the OnePlus 13.

https://youtu.be/Z27NWQ8QnhU

The Pixel, on a cloudy day, is lifeless.  So dull.  Washed out.  Colors are muted and meh.  Very disappointing.


It does surprisingly well with video in his test.
face id using different tech is truly what differs the face unlock on both ecosystem
And that's absolutely true.  On paper.  
As an IT Professional that's been supporting Android and iPhones since the beginning of Android and iPhones... And supports a mixed household of Android and iPhones: in practice, the difference isn't as staggering as you might think it is... today.
You can rescan your face a hundred times and it's not gonna get any better.  You have to keep in mind, people on this subreddit have largely only ever had Pixels, so every determination they make regarding a Pixel is only in comparison to past Pixels.  You are coming from the best device with regards to face unlock, then behind them is probably all the Chinese phones, then Samsung, and then the Pixel.  The Pixels face unlock, when compared to these other devices, is abysmal, but if you compare it to past Pixels it's GREAT!!!!
I just saw the image comparison you posted. I agree the raw image in lightroom honestly looks like a fog was over the lens or something; even I can see it.

Edit: when i look quickly in google i think many people have reported this issue as far back as the pixel 6. These threads from a few months ago has some ideas for [pixel 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1fiffdc/pixel_9_pro_raws_look_wrong/) and another for[ pixel 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lightroom/comments/17i6m0k/raws_imported_from_phone_look_soft_after_loading/).
I mean the OnePlus 13 was $790 shipped and you got a free watch at launch.  That's extremely low end flagship prices.

And the OnePlus 13 is capable of fantastic photos.  It is inconsistent, and part of what you have to deal with when buying from OnePlus is an understanding that the camera system ain't gonna be fully cooked until like the summer after you buy it.  Like the 12 launched with a meh camera, but by the summer there were endless updates that turned it into a damn good camera system.  The same is already shaping up for the 13, with two camera updates already since launch.
Personally a camera is not the top priority of a phone for me. The OnePlus 13 is over $400 cheaper with better specs over all other than the camera. It's still a flagship killer.
I'd have to test again. It's been a while since I've done anything and it'll be a bit different now that I'm using Affinity.
Your review is 🗑️. I say this as a current iPhone user.
I’m also a pixel user. I use both phones for real, not just to write bs reviews online. 

If I wanted a trash review from an iPhone user who’s not actually trying to use a pixel, I could watch every influencer YouTube video available. Because all of them do the same thing. 

You write a review of a pixel saying “it’s not an iPhone, what am I missing?” The answer IS THE PHONE ITSELF. 

If you dont use it enough to get it for what it is, and you can’t review it without comparing it to the thing you actually use then don’t be shocked when people tell you your methodology is flawed and get back to me when you’re willing to actually try to use the phone for real.
I'm sorry people can't seem to see that you want to make it work and are trying to ask for advice on how to get the camera work for you. 

In terms of locking third party apps, afaik they're not. Google's sauce is all computational photography, some of it on the cloud, some of it on their exclusive pixel app. This includes things like upscaling. There are (GCamera Ports) ports of it with more features like profiles and LUT, idk if they include the computational features. Same with your expectations of raw. A RAW is supposed to have the raw sensor dump so you'd have to process it to look as sharp etc yourself.
Well comparing and complaining about the specs of a phone will not help you feel better about your purchase.

Comparison is the thief of joy.

Now if there are technical issues, just ask how to fix those.

Otherwise just enjoy your phone cause nowadays the difference in phone specs are matters of splitting hairs at this point.
>nice
I’ve seen a lot of videos, especially now comparing pixel to the S25 series and haven’t come across any like you describe. Frequently the phones are so close it is up to personal preference.
You're welcome!
I've asked about RAW file itself. Not how it was rendered by google photos or lightroom. Want to try opening it in a few different converters...

Long times ago I had same almost same issue with just released Nikon D90 and some RAW converter where camera JPEG was MUCH better than RAW file. That was later fixed lately with converter update

PS. I'm not Pixel 9 owner, but thinking about buying it.
Not comparing prices as much as I'm giving an honest opinion about my experience, I still feel that I'm missing much even though I have been using it for over 3 months now, daily use
It’s pretty noticeable. I can have the lights completely off or just be in a dark place and my pixel wont unlock with face, but my iPhone will
Your experience doesn't invalidate the fact that they use two entirely different approaches, one that works in the dark and one that doesn't. And it's very easy to test yourself and see that Pixels never work in a dark room simply because they're using the camera alone. Meanwhile the iPhone has no problem even in zero light.
The crazy thing is, Pixel **used** to have amazing face unlock. The Pixel 4 with googles soli technology was on par with Apple's face id, it worked in the dark, with glasses on, etc. 

I have no idea why they ever abandoned it.
$1300 for a base OP13 (Canadian), for that I can get a S24U, or a iPhone 16 Pro, which unfortunately absolutely body the OP13, and my pixel does everything I need it too without any slowdown, including gaming, so at that price point, the OP13s are flagships themselves. Not flagship killers.
Try to open the DNG file on it, is it showing the same issue? I have uploaded the original files here on google drive

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TAQkFHn-NvMr5t8qAzNo_Is3dbCSJXkt?usp=sharing
Being an iPhone user will not give you more validation. I’m dtill talking about my experience here
Their critiques are still valid though. Their usage behavior actually highlights how these problems are apparent in the immediate, and there are still other problems they haven't experienced in the long run (which many others have already). 

Pixel problems and deficiencies are really easy to look up for every generation, including the latest. Tensor G5 already seems lacking, so I'm sure the same problems will persist.
I fully agree, I hate it when I hear people debating over phones like they are getting paid for it. 

I addressed the RAW images issue to the post, not sure if it is known issue or just a glitch in between apps
Perhaps you only saw reviews when the people were taking photos on extremely bright extremely sunny days.  Watch some reviews where the people are taking photos on cloudy days, and the lifeless photos the Pixel takes will leave you joyless.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z27NWQ8QnhU

You can see it with the photos this guy takes.  Pixel does well with the video when its bright and sunny out, and then he switches to photos when its overcast, and the Pixel is a joyless lifeless mess.
That’s good to know, hopefully they release some update to solve the issue,,

Here you go, I have uploaded both files into my google drive, not sure if there are any other website that supports DNG files.

I used the Pixel 7 pro for 2 years and a half or since it ever released.. one thing I hate is the massive value drop of pixel phones.. it's insane. My pixel 7 pro I bought it for 1000 euro now I can barely sell it anywhere for 190-260 euro lol, even stores offer 130 eur trade in if i wanted to buy a new phone. While the iPhone 13 is still being offered 350-400 eur for a trade in and 500-600 on used market.

  
So if you were in my shoes would you stick to the iPhone? You regret the pixel? I've about 14 days to try both so I will continue to do so just I dont have a phone case so its a bit risky.
I didn't say there's no difference. It's just not that profound.
Wow you get rinsed in Canadia Jesus... And I thought the UK had it pretty bad lol.
But to be clear in no way do any of those phones ""body"" the OnePlus 13. Even in camera performance it's pretty negligible these days.
It does look a little soft before doing any correction to it out the gate but I think that may be from exposure/curves.  [https://imgur.com/a/iS3MZzy](https://imgur.com/a/iS3MZzy)

Without playing around a bit to see what could work it's hard to say but it doesn't look like it's softening it a lot.  I wish there was a lens profile for the Pixels in Affinity again to see if that would help.
Your experience is not complete, as your title says. You’re welcome to post drivel, I’m welcome to call it that.
And my critique of his review and methodology is too.
This looks like lightroom issue. Here is what I've got using darktable: [https://imgur.com/a/yWNUGGQ](https://imgur.com/a/yWNUGGQ)

First photo: no edits, just import and then screenshot

Second: just added exposure and no other edits.

I like this much better than your Lightroom export.

As about lost of sharpening: I think it could be not a problem of RAW file itself, but actual quality of picture that you get from sensor before all of google algorithmic photography cheats..
Im saying it is pretty profound under low light conditions. Its not unlockable in a dark room or area, where an iPhone is. I would say not being able to unlock using face id in low light is pretty significant of a difference
It's because we don't market any Chinese company mobile devices anymore, and we also have a increased tax for the ones being sent to the country iirc.
Turned out that Lightroom applies Pixel profile once importing RAW pixel image, which causes the issue in the first place. Navigate to profile, either change to Adobe colors, or slide Pixel profile to 0

Not really. We should always advocate for improvements, especially in regards to basic problems that other OEMs solved years ago. These negative experiences are not an isolated experience, and are everywhere in subreddits and Google support pages
That’s disappointing to hear, I pay a monthly subscription for Adobe and I’m used to their Lightroom app. I opened the same files from my computer, same issue with Lightroom app on Mac. 

Any recommendations for good apps to edit DNG on Pixel?
Yeah in the UK OnePlus 13 is £899 and s25 ultra is £1249 so massive difference.
Canada is weird.  Extremely wary of letting the Chinese sell cheap phones, but let them buy up all of the real estate absolutely ruining the market.
Interesting, Affinity uses an open source solution to correct for the lens.  I could've tried applying one of the other lens profiles to see what it would do.
Not really. Good day sir.

GooglePixel,Pixel 9 Pro WiFi disconnecting issue,"I love my Pixel 9 Pro, but the one issue I'm facing is that several times a day it will disconnect from my home WiFi and switch to 4G. I can reconnect fine manually.

I've tried turning off adaptive connectivity, resetting the WiFi and Bluetooth settings, setting the WiFi as unmetered, and changing the WiFi channel in my router settings from auto to 36, none have made a difference.

Has anyone else experienced this and found a solution? I never had the issue on my previous S21 with the same router

Comments:
What kind of router? Have you checked if there's an update for its firmware? My impression is that Pixels don't play well with certain routers because Google constantly updates security settings while the routers do not. That discrepancy is often the source of the problem.
Hi Luke, I've been experiencing the same problem (Pixel 9 PRO XL) for a few days now, since I installed a new modem/router, the Keenetic Hopper DSL.

I had Google Wifi Pro before, and I had no problems.

I have a Oneplus and about 40 home automation devices at home, and I have no problems with wifi.

I also think it's due to a Pixel update.
Try changing the channel to 35. I've seen tons of people saying to use that channel specifically. I had a wifi connectivity issue for a weekend after I bought my P9ProXL. Just bit the bullet and upgraded my cable home wifi to fiber and grabbed an up to date router. 

Haven't been randomly d/c'd since and I'm loving the fiber speeds.
Ciao ho lo stesso problema. Pixel 9 PRO XL con router Keenetic.  
Ho l'impressione che sia dovuto all'ultimo update di google play.

Al momento nessuna soluzione.  
Con Oneplus o iPhone nessun problema
Hi there, I’d recommend reaching out to the Google Pixel support team via phone or chat [here](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/gethelp?sjid=6851008259052488150-AP). They can take a look at it.
It's a Technicolor DGA0122 which we got from our ISP when switching to full fibre last year. It doesn't look like there's any new firmware
I have a Pixel 9 pro also, my wife has Pixel 7. The wifi on both got messed up with a recent Google update, as things were rock solid until a couple weeks go or so. Possibly specific to using mesh systems - it happens both at work and at home, so not a router issue. Happens with adaptive connectivity both on or off. Definitly a recent problem with the Pixels, and really annoying.
36 is the lowest channel I can select unfortunately for the 5GHz WiFi

GooglePixel,Getting a text every time I have a voicemail,"I just set up a new Pixel 9 from my Pixel 8 and I remember selecting something in the set up that asked if I wanted to get voicemails sent to text.  I thought it was asking if I wanted voicemails to show up as text/transcripts like they currently do in the voicemail area.  However, I found out that I get a text message from my number telling me that I have a voicemail from a number, the transcript (if there is one) and telling me to call the vmail number to listen to it.  I don't want these but I can't find the setting to turn this off.  Can anyone help?

Comments:
Sounds more like a provider setting. Check there if the text reminder is turned on.
See if your carrier has a visual voicemail app. If they do download it and go to settings. Most likely the option to turn it off will be there
There are usually settings in the voicemail service itself. Dial into the voicemail box and listen to all the different settings.
Hi there. I recommend contacting Google Fi support by phone or chat [here](https://support.google.com/fi/gethelp?sjid=12324877458943033926-NC). They can have a look at it.
Maybe.  However, I've been on Google Fi for both and don't remember this question when I set up the pixel 8. Sorry for the dumb question but when you say text reminder, where would I look for that?  I didn't see anything like that in the vmail or text settings
Oddly enough, I just checked the settings on my new phone with my old one and can't find any differences!  Frustrating!
I think you mean you get an text message if you receive a voicemail correct? Usually that's a carrier/provider setting to turn off or on. For example if I call my voicemail I can select it from the settings menu (it tells me which buttons to press) to turn text notifications on or off. However your provider/carrier can work differently.
Also look in the phone app, settings and then visual voicemail.",2025-01-31 17:54:05,1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1iekqwa/getting_a_text_every_time_i_have_a_voicemail/

Do a hard reset of the buds to the factory defaults. Make sure you use the Samsung companion app and correct driver for the Pro buds. Good luck.

GooglePixel,Pixel 9 stopped reading my SIM card after just a month,"Anybody experienced a similar problem? I got my Pixel 9 for christmas. For about three weeks it kept randomly asking for my SIM PIN code about once a week, I tought it was weird but whatever. Now it asks for the PIN every 20 seconds or soy the PIN screen keeps flashing as the SIM card is connecting and disconnecting. When I restart the phone it works fine for roughly 5 minutes before it comes back. 

I solved the problem for now by switching to an eSIM, but I will have to deal with it properly sooner or later. Honestly really disappointed. It's my first Pixel and also my very first phone that physically broke by itself in 20+ years of owning phones.

Comments:
You're sure it wasn't the physical sim that was faulty?
Get a sim card replacement. Sounds like it could be a sim card issue.
Warranty it.
I had a similar issue years ago on my pixel 4xl. It would randomly loose 4g connection and I'd need to reboot to get it back. I switched to eSIM at that time on the off chance it might fix it and never had issues after that.

I really don't understand how physical sim cards are still a thing eSIM just makes so much more sense and it would surely save some production costs and allow a little bit more room inside the phone if the sim tray and connection didn't need to be there.
I had a similar issue with my Pixel 4a (phone randomly lost connection to SIM), which I managed to fix by cutting a few layers of paper in the shape of the sim and placing it in the tray underneath the SIM card to create a better connection.

Might not help in your case, but worth a try.
Nope no issues on a release date phone.
Yep, already changed it. Didn't help.
That was the first thing I did. No change.
Well that sucks. Time for an RMA.

GooglePixel,LPT for optical fingerprint,"If your phone isn't reading your fingerprint... try wetting your finger. I noticed this ages ago, others have mentioned this in comments here and there but I haven't seen any detailed posts about this. When you register your fingerprint, it is conditional. Meaning, if you have very dry hands then it will record a dry fingerprint (or vice versa). This is also why it's so effective to register the same finger multiple times. Pixel 9's ultrasonic reader works on a different principle, and conveniently doesn't blind you during the night.

Comments:
Back when I had a P6P and P7P I noticed that trying to clean my finger or something made it worse. When I gave up trying it worked more reliably. How odd.
This tends to work for older people's fingerprints too, wet then dry then scan
I have hyperhidrosis and my hands sweat an obscene amount. I always have a separate wet and dry fingerprint in my phone, and I strongly recommend everyone else do the same. Maybe I'm just lucky or maybe the phone is just new, but this type of fingerprint reader seems to have a higher success rate than my last phone (S21 FE 5G, US version)
So if I'm getting this right- have the phone ""learn"" your finger prints with wet finger tips? Then it will better recognize them moving forward?
> If your phone isn't reading your fingerprint... try wetting your finger.

Great advice. But what about single guys?

^SCNR
There is also an option to enable for those who have screen protection. Maybe that can solve some problems.
i have a profile for every season as my thumb gets noticeably dryer in the winter seasons lol
It won't matter. The optical is so bad.  Just registering your finger in current conditions is what makes it recognize your finger.   When conditions change the same problem will come back.   I went back to a Pixel 5a after trying anything with an optical.  The 9's ultrasonic of course is way better and works. I'm just waiting for the price to go down as i'm in one of those plans that it will cost me more to get a subsidized phone then flat out buy the phone.

The 9A might be getting a different ultrasonic reader from a cheaper company.  But we'll find out when it gets released.
Not just wet, but a little oily. I found swiping the tip of my thumb across my forehead usually does the trick, even if I look ridiculous in the moment.
In 2+ yrs of having my P7P, I can count on one hand how many times the fingerprint scanner hasn't worked the first time. 


So I guess I have pretty consistent moisture levels on my finger skin. Cool.

Briar is a special case, because AFAIK that's an ""offline"" messenger, right? It normally uses BT and WiFi to form a peer-to-peer messaging network independent of the internet. So it doesn't use Google's push notification system. The app needs to be running as a foreground service to be reliable. Does it appear in the ""[Active apps](https://i.imgur.com/OAItuNV.png)"" [list](https://i.imgur.com/fHrxyAH.png)? Most apps also put some kind of permanent service notification which doesn't go away when you tap ""clear all"".

Dunno how Ring Central works but it might have a similar issue if it doesn't use Google's push service.
Briar shows-up in that list. Ring Central does not. But I have also noticed, when the issue happens, it cuts internet for every app. Even things like Google maps. It comes back once I start using the device for a minute or two but there is a very noticeable outage.
Looks like you're losing internet system wide. Does this also happen on WiFi?",2025-01-30 23:22:34,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ie0ph7/apps_losing_connection_hibernating_when_not_using/
GooglePixel,Google Wallet Just Changed My Life,"Alright, so I just found out I can add my driver’s license, car insurance card, vehicle registration, and even my health insurance card to Google Wallet, and I’m absolutely mind blown. I use a Pixel 9 Pro XL

I mean, my physical wallet used to be this overstuffed disaster waiting to explode. Every time I needed something, I had to dig through a stack of cards like I was shuffling a deck for blackjack. Now? Everything I need is right there on my phone.

I tested it today, and it felt like some next-level futuristic magic. Got pulled over? Boom, driver's license and registration. Doctor’s office? Health insurance card ready to go. I didn’t even realize how much unnecessary junk I was carrying around until now.

I’m honestly impressed with how seamless it all is. If I could just figure out how to add my car keys to my phone, I’d never have to carry anything again.

Anyone else tried this? It feels like a total game-changer for me.

Yes pretty cool, but the License, registration, and  passport is a US-only feature at this stage. Bummer!
I tried using my digital driver's license at a bar and they were like what is this
So when you get pulled over, you're handing the officer your active, unlocked phone?

That sounds like a bad idea...

Edit:
App pinned, phone locked.  Whatever.  I'm not handing my phone to an officer who's going to walk back to the police car and do whatever for as long as the officer likes.. 

Or could try to do the face unlock once out of my hands...

The Wallet app has a lot of great uses. Just not this one for me.
It's all steps in the right direction but it doesn't really replace your physical driver's license for most cases. The most useful thing it does is allow you to NFC tap your ID to TSA when you travel. Until the rest of the world who might need your ID starts putting NFC terminals everywhere, you really have to hang onto that card a bit longer...
Great! But I want you to be prepared so... If you lost your phone... Where are your cards? 

Do not forget a plan B, all I'm saying. 

Plan C is flexible.
I have nothing to hide but last thing I would hand over to an LEO is my personal phone. LE has software and toolkits that can dump your phone's content out of your sight. If it's unlocked and you hand over the device, they can review your opened apps, text history, etc. You hand them your phone and guess what, they can look through it without a warrant and your rights are gone. They can take my physical DL and run back to their MDC and look it up or call dispatch to pull my DMV information. My phone stays with me.
Have you tried purchasing tobacco or alcohol with your id in google wallet?
I wouldnt want to give my phone to a cop just so he can write me a ticket
[deleted]
It's nice that your state has that. Mine does not. I'm able to put my gym membership barcode and shoot that over to my watch though so I can scan in and unlock the door without taking my phone out of my pocket. Been using wallet style card holder phone cases for a while and it's nice to not need both a wallet and a phone. I use a pretty slim minimalist wallet and I keep most of my cards in the safe. I usually bounce around with only a tile slim, insurance card, one credit card, DL, and some cash in the wallet.

My dad has a fat wallet with every damned credit card and debit card to his name in the thing. I'm always trying to convince him to leave some of that stuff in a safe at home.

Limit what you can lose and what can be stolen from you at one time imo.
I used my mobile license in Google Wallet at the TSA checkpoint in the airport and was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. Just tapped the receiver then pressed okay on my phone screen to authorize the transfer of info.  Didn't have to hand anything over.
I'm in Aus, we have loyalty cards for grocery shopping and one of the stores just lets you put your phone near the payment terminal and just registers your loyalty card without needing to scan it!

I love making payments without pulling out cards.

It saves event/movie tickets too!
FYI, if you are pulled over, you still have to have your physical DL on you. The Google wallet version doesn't count.
And now Google have all your personal, sensitive information.
Here in my country we have a government app for that (drivers license, ID card, etc).
Literally me, with my empty real wallet now LMAO
My state doesn't support IDs yet if I recall correctly.
I've got my debit card, an assortment of loyalty cards, a Walmart gift card that might be empty, and my library card in my Google Wallet. I still have my old lady wallet in my big black purse, though, in case tap is having an off day. My husband has an iPhone and can't figure out Apple Pay (or whatever) to save his life. 

I'm in Canada.
Passport too. I Found Wallet just last month.
I do alcohol deliveries with DoorDash, Instacart and Spark. Unless you hand me your actual physical driver's license (or state ID), you are not getting your alcohol. If it's a Spark (Walmart) delivery, your entire order is going back to the store.
No way I am putting my license and registration in my phone. No way I am handing my unlocked phone to a police officer during a stop.
Big brother says, ""you're welcome""
Well, in Portugal we have a government app that lets you have you ID, social security, drivers licence, all your cars registration numbers, etc. and it's totally valid to be used with the authorities. So we only kinda use android wallet to pay with NFC
>so I just found out I can add my driver’s license, car insurance card, vehicle registration, and even my health insurance card to Google Wallet,

Yikes. No thanks

No chance I will be giving Google this data let alone a police officer my phone without a warrant.
I might be an outlier here, but I still prefer to have all those things as physically accessible. I don't wanna be handing my cell phone over to people to check my ID or health insurance or to pay for things. I like my cell phone to be a tool, but I don't want it to be my entire life.
That's strange.
Even in the edit menu?
That's where mine originally was.
But it still says unavailable.
I added everything to mine, where I live we have a separate app for licence. Living the walletless dream
Wish they would make the top ""add payment"" tile the size of all the others. No need for it to be 2/3 of the screen
I have the Pixel Watch 3 and if you double tap the crown it's a shortcut to open the digital wallet. Just having my primary debit card in there has been such a convenience.
This is an absolutely amazing and very useful feature. I've been using this a few months now and it's just great. I have everything in there.
Awesome, thanks for this! Don't have to carry my driving licence about all the time now.
Ontario and many places are looking at digital wallets as an acceptable source of id.

Cops will have to be equipped with scanners to read it because nobody is giving them their phone.
DO NOT under any circumstances (other than a written warrant) give your phone to a cop.   This should be common sense.
[deleted]
I have my car keys added to my Pixel
only like 5 states support the drivers license lame
I went to a bar and they wouldn't accept the id on my phone. I am also 47 so I have no idea why they needed to seem my id in the first place.
Honestly, what we have with Google Wallet is just a glimpse of the level of daily convenience people over in China have.
In CA, it said the digital ID supported but when you buy some alcohol, like a box of beers, the grocery store still needs your physical ID
It would be nice if it was avaliable everywhere... Google has always been extremely slow on releasing their products worldwide. Whether it's software or hardware
For 4 years now, I have not carried a wallet with me at all. Google wallet + Diia (Ukrainian gov app with all major documents).
And you do realize that when you hand your unlocked phone to the police, they can look at anything they want, including texts, email, etc? Until they make it so that this data can be accessed while the phone remains locked I would never even consider this. Even then , handing them your device does not guarantee that they will return it. they can hold onto it as ""evidence"".
My advice is to think twice before you store anything in Google wallet. Google will have even more information about you than what they already have. For example, they would know where you shop with your credit cards; they would know what credit cards you have; they potentially would know what conditions you might have. It's all aggregated data that can use for advertisement. Handing your phone with an image of your DL to a cop? Bad idea, sorry.
I found I mostly use Google Wallet for organizing digital gift cards
Is this just a pixel 9 pro benefit?
Couldn't you have just taken a photo of those things on your phone?
I don't have my license/registration on here but I can slide two cards into my phone case; I haven't carried a physical wallet for about 8 years.
My car key is also my phone!
does this feature work in Australia?

So many actual good features like this, call notes, call recording etc all banned and missing in other regions...
Not here in Europe you cant.
Just remember that typically when you get pulled over, a police officer will take your license and registration to their vehicle. Are you ready to hand over your unlocked phone instead?
In most jurisdictions, police will not accept a Google wallet liscense.
Man I can’t fully go with a pixel watch because it doesn’t do nfc reader for universities. Hoping that soon ecounts changes that.
It's cool but this amazes me how carrying a few cards is a life changing problem for you.
Yeah lol
I also set mine up with all my cards just a few weeks ago
So you went and got pulled over to test it? Brilliant!
Have you been pulled over yet? I highly doubt any police officer anywhere will take your driver's license and registration on your Pixel. It's funny to even think so. I think you'll have to carry some things whether you want to or not.
Yeah, that's a super great idea to give Google direct access to all of that personal information. Also great to hand your phone to a police officer who can legally search through it at any time. The wonders of modern technology.
Only limited to a few states even. Mine wasn't listed
Speaking as an american, I will never hand my unlocked phone to law enforcement.
I discover more and more functions for the US and this makes me sad.
I've got my driver's licence and car rego in my Google wallet app in Australia. Not sure about passport I haven't needed it yet.
Definitely yep, hopefully it becomes world wide.
Looking to have that extended to other countries and more banks to the wallet along with other brand/loyalty cards in similar magnitude to apple wallet.

This is the only element where it locks against that apple ecosystem
Sucks that's only for US.
In Portugal we have a gov app to add that info. It's actually a nice feature to not have to have my wallet.
When/if it reaches the Google Wallet (or even iOS thingy I don't recall) it would be an awesome feature.
No it isn't. My Dutch passport and driving licence are in my wallet.
lmao
In Ohio they added Apple Wallet support for licenses with GWallet coming soon. But they're kind of useless right now. Stores and bars need a NFC reader thing to get the info off of it.
I'm curious what customs would say with a digital passport
Did you get in though?
I'll happily count myself as a nerd for this - it'd be a hoot to do this at bar that's a bit more ""edgy than most"", in particular, just for the reaction.  Better be ready to back it up with the old plastic one though, for a good long while...
Nerd
I asked about the digital ID at the DMV and the clerk looked at me and immediately without hesitation said do not ever use it with a cop. You're giving them the freedom to search your phone
well, this isn't how it's supposed to work with digital wallet IDs. 

digital IDs are supposed to be scanned the same way you pay for something with Google Wallet. You get presented with a NFC device that you just tap. 

it's supposed to be more private because for certain situations like showing ID to get into a bar, it'll only show the bouncer the required info such as your age without showing them your address. 

but of course, we're nowhere close to having everyone carrying such devices (unless they find a way to incorporate these into phones)
You can pin Google Wallet but then of course they can go through anything in your Google Wallet. App pinning would be better than just handing over a completely unlocked phone.
Yeah, that's why I don't have my DL/Insurance cards on my phone .. Get a warrant and then we'll talk
some cops were busted here for extracting nude pics from women's phones.  i guess now i know how that happened....
After seeing several cases where police just walk off with the phone, steal pics of your partner, find texts saying you were drinking, etc. I don't even use my insurance's app. I don't own a printer but also a mile to a FedEx Kinkos every 3 months to pick up a print of my insurance card. Keep it and the registration in a sleeve in my center console. 
Added benefit of also not having my insurance app steal my driving information and use it against me.
It's pretty tragic how little Americans trust their police. Not saying it isn't warranted but I would never worry about this in Australia.
My thoughts exactly.
They just scan mine with a QR scanner. Don't need my phone :)

But I live in Denmark and have a drivers license app
More like for picking up stuff at the post office or renewing your library card. You should have the original document with you (plastic ID card) whenever you are driving
Yeah. Once again we are going to lose more rights because the general population can't understand what's harmful to them.
You are just creating scenarios in your head, man
You don't need to hand the officer your phone. It's just easiest to hand a license. You can absolutely ask them to just write down your DL# which is all they need.
You are not automatically consenting for them to search everything
You can just swipe up your phone and open the wallet , or you can just lock the app to only Google wallet.
Exactly, I was also able to scan my passport, the way it was done is super impressive, all I did was hold my phone to the back of my passport n it scanned all the data in the chip n registered it on my wallet after google verified it. Apple Wallet and Samsung Wallet need to catch up.
Definetly yes, I feel safer carrying my phone in my pocket over my wallet in the US if ya know what I mean.
You make a really valid point, and honestly, I hadn't thought about it that way. Privacy is definitely a concern, especially with how easily data can be accessed once a phone is unlocked. I guess I was just hyped about the convenience of having everything in one place.

That being said, I agree with you handing over your phone, even for something simple like a license check, can open a door you don’t want opened. It's definitely a case of balancing convenience with protecting your rights. Maybe the move is to keep a physical copy of critical IDs as a backup, just in case. Thanks for bringing this perspective into the conversation!
Or, you need to carry a second phone with your DL, no incriminating info, and built in fake alibis (texts like ""baby, I had a great time staying in with you at your house all last night!"") to hand over to the police whenever you commit crimes... 😁
Exactly right but, in the long run, the idea isn't to hand over your phone, it's to perform an NFC tap. Of course, that requires that the police have the appropriate technology on their end.

But, yes, never hand over your phone.
you can pin apps and the person you're giving your phone to can only view that app specifically
I haven't tried it yet, I will try in the future, it actually has a photo of thr ID stored on the side along the written date processed by Google for view so I think it should work just fine. I'm in US.
Is there a way to find out if my car supports  it?
So in order to add the registration, insurance card and DL all you have to do is go to add wallet-everything else and you add it manually, it works like a charm.
Yeah its seemless n super smooth, even registering your passport to the add is so neat how you put it back of the passport and it scans the chip. Apple Wallet and Samsung gotta catch up.
Yeah exactly I am all about convenience, gotta love it!!!
Ofc yes, it all depends on the officer really.
R.I.P
How has this changed? They've had all your data for decades...
Hopefully soon
This gave me a good laugh! Sounds like you’ve got the best of both worlds tech-savvy with Google Wallet but still rocking the trusty “old lady wallet” for those unpredictable tap failures. Honestly, it’s a smart move.

As for your husband, maybe he’s just sticking to his roots with the old-school method? Or maybe Apple Pay is his kryptonite. Either way, I bet he’s secretly impressed by your digital wallet expertise (even if he’d never admit it).
I already added mine, love how it scanned the chip in the passport from the back and everything got added.
Party pooper! :)
Just pin the app
To each their own, Google made it for people who prefer it that way ya know what I mean.
Love it, might get one soon.
It works the same on my Pixel 2 watch.  Just tested mine.
They can talk all they want about AI n gimmicks
But these are the actual features we want that will make a difference in our daily life.
Right ? Amazing stuff
Glad I could help
Hopefully everyone catches up
Even in the US they’re not fully there yet.
Google Wallet has been out since 2011
It's not going anywhere soon.
Make?
That's because most places now days scans you id.
We've already sold our souls to google.
Try to utilize it more with other stuff and it will become your fav digital wallet.
Google Wallet as a whole I believe
or just through it all in your google wallet? like its on your phone for a reason.
BMW?
idk tbh I am in the US, I wish you guys had more features the ones outside the US like most are region locked.
Hopefully soon
I will pin the app so its locked when I have over my phone
If legal in your state then take advantage
For those interested, it's only AZ, CA, CO, GA, MD, and NM. Pretty short list, just a hair over 10% of all available states if we're going by state count. But by population it's a bit more than that (iirc, CA alone is like 10% of the entire US).
With so many personal things on phones these days I wouldn't hand my unlocked phone to anyone I didn't know well.
This is what I was about to say. There's no way in hell I'm handing my phone to a cop, period.
Good, cause you still need your physical drivers license when you're driving.  In MD at least.
What do you have to hide?
Don't be too sad... we have an orange clown in charge, only three or four phone OEM""s to chose from, internet data costs are 5 times higher than the rest of the world, and 90% of the country still cannot do what the OP is so impressed with! The US is not all its cracked up to be!
Yeah I can add my license here in New Zealand too but it isn't like an official or accepted representation. We do have a standalone NZTA app for vehicle registration and a warrant of fitness. They'll likely add the license feature to that.
How did you add your license to the wallet? I can't find add id option. Did you just take a photo?
Which state? In Victoria I have my licence on the VicRoads app but I don't think we can put it on Google Wallet.
God dammit I read your post and I grabbed phone searching where to add my DL... lol come Back and read that it's only USA for now 😅damn.
But yes, the wallet is deadly 👌
Also my P6P has the ""add digital car keys"" tile from the drop down menu at the top but says unavailable.
Whats yours say? Wish I could add a screenshot.
Exactly. They should be able to get an app that reads it as all modem phones have NFC abilities
doubt they will even let you on the plane
She let it slide but was not thrilled
One of us
It depends on your state. California, for example, recently integrated their ID system with Google Wallet and Apple Wallet. They required all police cars, government buildings, airports, etc. to be outfitted with NFC ID readers, and anyone that checks ID for things like selling alcohol has to have NFC ID readers as well.

Meanwhile in stupid Utah, they rolled their own system that doesn't integrate with Wallet apps, so you have to get a janky piece of trash mobile app that barely work to get a digital ID, and they also won't require police cars, government buildings, airports, etc. to support the digital cards so you quite literally can't use the digital ID as a replacement for your physical license at all.
My point is, if I'm pulled over then it's physical license and registration. 

I'm sure there's lots of good use cases...
I have them on my phone for my own reference but a cop is only ever getting the physical cards 
What are y'all hiding to not give the officer your phone? For me, they can take it and look at it. Not going to find anything. I'm not a cartel or anything.
Get a cheap laser printer. Unlike an inkjet, it can sit there forever and still work the one or two times a year you want to use it.
It's Not only americans. I as a german, would in no way do hand my onlocked phone to a cop. Never! My best friend is a cop and even she says things like this are a bad idea.
The law in Australia states that the police are not meant to take your phone, only look at it with the license displayed.
Perhaps, but it's also true:

The biometric security feature, used in lieu of a passcode on Apple's later-model iPhones, allows people to unlock their phones with just a scan of the face.

I'm still not handing my phone to an officer who goes back to the police car to do whatever... and is out of my sight for as long as the officer likes.
How can you lock it to one app?
Just checked, can't add a Missouri ID ""yet"" :(
Do you drive a BMW?
Only 6 states in the US support this. If you're pulled over and you're using like a photo of your license the cop may just call it driving without a license. From there it can escalate into something else.
I understand only the newer issued US passports include that technology.

Mine does not.
I think it's his kryptonite *and* he likes the old-school ways-- he actually even prefers cash to card any day (but hates carrying coins). One of our grown daughters uses Apple Pay all the time, and tried (unsuccessfully) to walk him through it. And, I mean, were not old-- early 50s. And he's otherwise pretty tech-savvy. I tell him it's because Apple sucks lol
I am still never handing my phone over to anyone.
Totally. Google is doing everything in their power to make sure everything about your life is Google related. Driving, payments, health, all in Google's ecosystem.
Exactly bro. Makes my life 10x easier and way more organized!
Yeah. Some want to make their own app. Government apps don't work out in Canada. Newly arrived, COVID, etc.
24 Hyundai Elantra N-line with Pixel 9 Pro XL
Of course they did.  The point is, even in the state which officially supports digital ID, you still need to take the physical ID with you
That's right. At least we don't want to sell our behind to them too!
I basically only shop with cash so that's gonna be a no from me, dawg
Yeh but how has it changed your life. Now it's in the wallet on your phone instead of the photo reel. It's not like there was no way you could have had it on your phone before.
Tesla
Sorry no. I am never going to just surrender my phone to a LEO at a traffic stop.
I believe Ohio is coming soon. The state supports digital ID now.
I would not give my locked device to anyone, (including the police)
Why would you ever have to?
What are you hiding?
Thank you. That's good to know. 
I don't think we suggested it was. But it's still annoying that you get Google features we don't.
> internet data costs are 5 times higher than the rest of the world

Where did you get this from lol, definitely not true
So wrong!  Why put out this misleading/BS info!
I think if you go to add to wallet and click everything else and scan your DL it should work.
Did she just look at it or was there some kind of reader?
> janky piece of trash mobile app that barely work to get a digital ID

Sounds like your average government project. 
I bet it cost $50 million, too.
It's not that I'm hiding anything, but that's overreach and invasion of privacy. Plus, exercising ones right(s) shouldn't immediately make once suspicious, by anyone.
Liberties do not exist solely for those that need them.  Because you don't feel your liberty is at stake, and you comply, you make it harder for people that need that liberty to exercise their Constitutional rights.  Do not compromise your liberty, you may need it one day.
You assume people want to hide illegal shit. I'm just not willing to bet the cop is clean.
Brother HL-L2360DW has been a faithful little beast for years.
Many cops won't do anything more than they are supposed to be doing, but there's always going to be some that will poke around to see what you're up to. Even if you're not doing anything illegal, you now have a cop asking you to explain anything they happen to find and possibly even keep your phone while they go through it while they investigate anything suspicious. There's literally no upside to giving your phone to the police.
If you read the 9th Cir decision, the defendant was a parolee and CA law allows the police to engage in a suspicionless search of any property under their control. The part about fingerprints is generally applicable, but only in cases where the police have the right to search your phone in the first place, which they did there because he was a parolee.
Same. It's handy for my personal references and if needed at a bar. And that's it.
To each their own, I guess it's good to have a psychical license if that's the case. I just really value convenience.
Open Settings
Select Security and privacy
Select More security and privacy
Select App pinning and turn it on
Go to add wallet,everything else then scan the ID.
Infinity QX56 2023
I guess just have it with you physically in case something happens so yeah.
Yeah I got my new passport issues last year in October.
Haha, sounds like he’s stuck in the “cash is king” mindset, minus the coins! Love that your daughter tried to help classic dad move to resist. And you’re right, early 50s isn’t old at all,it’s just Apple making things harder so you can win the Apple vs. Android battle. Google Wallet for the win!
To each their own so I understand
I agree yep
You already know my guy!
Nice!
Well I am in TN and they won't take E-ID at booze store. They scan it. And state troopers here scan your DL. It's not ready excepted if it's E anything here yet lol.
To each their own 👌🏼
Nice!
So whats the point of Google creating the app pin feature? you can just pin the app n lock it to google wallet when you hand your phone.
Bruh, read the thread
What a shit response and thought to have. You close the door when you go to the bathroom... Everyone knows what you're doing in there, but you'd still like to keep it private, right? How about conversations with your doctor? Your lover? Your mom?

For all of human history except the past couple decades, privacy is the default. Insinuating people have something arbitrarily bad to hide as the only reason for not sharing literally everything is rather insidious. Also, saying you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is like saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say. The principle is still important regardless of how you feel, it applies to you.

Do better, for yourself and everyone else.
It is Not a scientific statement. I've read many times in several sites that internet access costs with copious amounts of data is much cheaper than in the US! Five times as much was an exaggeration because I do not know what the difference is. I think they also get faster speeds per dollar than we do???
I'll check it out.
Does yours show digit car keys on the drop down menu that you swip down at the top with a finger? Mine is near the bottom of the list. Same menu tiles like the internet and Bluetooth ect.
Just looked. Small bar
And the company is run by some politician's wife's cousin.
Exactly
I'm not saying it's a bad idea all around.  

Just come police time, I'm handing over my physical license and registration, not my phone.
I don't understand why you're getting blasted with downvotes for liking google wallet.
Just did it and I thought I was fucked lol I didn't read the message that you have to swipe and hold to unpin and I thought I was screwed lol
Only certain states support digital IDs. You can't add an ID from an unsupported state.
Then no. Only BMW as of right now. Many more coming soon but today... Just them.
I worked in embedded device security for many years. Working on security related issues leaves you with a certain level of paranoia that is hard to shake. The amount of personal data contained in that little brick is huge.

But yeah, to each their own.
Beware once you open your phone to show I'd the law has authorization to search your phone. Just watch out
That's not hard to get around. It's like the lock on the door on your house, it just keeps honest people out.
Info on the wallet is not valid.  You still need a valid driver's license, registration, etc.  Pictures on the Google wallet does not replace the actual item. Thus, you do not need EVER to show LEO your phone.  Got it, Bruh?  Carry on.
You go to the bathroom on your phone?  How odd?  You are a strange person.  🥱
I mean in my southern European country I'm paying ~$40/month for 200/100mbps, is that cheap for you? Also that's the fastest speed you can get here lol

GooglePixel,Longevity of Pixel phones,"I am the type of person that only buys a new phone if my current starts to lag in every day tasks, if the battery lasts less than a day or if the software no longer receives security patches.

Having said that, software support for my 1+ Nord 2 is coming to an end and I am looking for a replacement.

My top candidates are S25 and Pixel 9.

Part of me really wants a Pixel due to the superb photos (even though comparatively I won't be able to zoom in as much as with an S25).

However, due to limited performance of the P9, I am worried it will not last too long with its current snappiness.

Could pixel owners comment on this?

Edit:
---
Thanks for the responses. It seems most people have had older pixels for 4+ years without issues (except some 4a). I guess I can safely assume that given a bit of luck Pixel phones should last for the software support period.

Comments:
Well, I've been using a Pixel 4a 5G from 2020 for the last four years and counting, still solid. I don't game or do much video processing though.
I had a Pixel 3 for about 3 years. I got it used so it was about 4 yrs old when I finally upgraded to the Pixel 7. Which I have now. Been going strong for 2 years and zero issues. Battery life is still really good.
It's hard to say anything useful about the longevity of phones this new or phones that aren't even out yet. 

My pixel 4a is going through a whole update of doom fiasco right now so it's hard to recommend a pixel at all. Even on an old budget phone I don't notice a lot of lag for normal phone stuff.

My suggestion would be to wait and make sure there are no problems at launch and then let the price and popularity of the phones be your guide.

If you keep the phone long enough longevity eventually comes down to repairability. The more popular device will have the most support in terms of parts availability and shops that can repair it. If you can walk into a local shop and get a screen or battery replacement easily and affordably you probably will do that. If you have to send the phone off and be without one for a bit or travel far away a lot of people will just opt to replace it. The more popular phone will likely have the best options for protective cases too.

Honestly there are a lot of other reasons to pick one over the other that are more tangible and immediate than unknowable longevity like Samsung DEX or Pixel call screening.
There’s still a few outstanding hardware issues that remains unresolved and frankly have no clear pattern. It is likely hardware will fail first before the phone feels laggy.
I'm on a Pixel 9 Pro now.  I had the 6, 7 and 8 Pro.  I've had some bad luck with Pixels with heat mostly.  This 9 Pro has been good, except over the last few weeks notifications and delayed or don't arrive and media sometimes just stops suddenly.

I was on with Google support last night and they recommended turning off adaptive battery and uninstalling and reinstalling apps and it's very frustrating when this phone is only a few months old. So I am weighing an option of maybe just grabbing a Galaxy s25 Ultra. The camera is not as good on the Galaxy but their software is pretty incredible.
My Pixel 4a served me 3 years after Google deliberately bricked my phone. After 2 years I had to charge my phone twice a day. But now I have to constantly connect my phone to a power bank, don't know after replacing the battery it'll be fixed or not. Ordered a S25. Snapdragon 8 elite is a very efficient chipset, should last a few years. The difference between Pixel 9 and Samsung is that samsung has a very efficient chipset with a 4000 mAh battery, on the other hand Pixel OS is very optimized with a 4700 mAh battery.
If you can wait for Pixel 10, I would recommend waiting if not go for S25 currently.
I have been using Pixel 6 pro now for almost 4 years
my Pixel 3XL lasted 6 years.  Still functional, but upgraded to the Pixel 8 when it came out with some really good incentives.
I replaced my Pixel 2XL with a Pixel 6 because the software updates were discontinued.  Now that I am on the Pixel 9 Pro, I still use my Pixel 2XL, and it's pretty decent.  I had to replace the battery, but no other repairs.
I had a pixel 2xl, it was a great phone - I only replaced it with a pixel 6 when I dropped it and the screen shattered. The pixel 6 is still running fine, though I just upgraded to the 9 pro - I really didn't need to, but there was a sweet black Friday deal I couldn't refuse. The build quality on this one seems better than the 6 even, I don't expect longevity issues
I love my pixel 9 pro xl. But it is definitely not a powerhouse.
My pixel 3XL still works great.

It's been the backup phone of the family
My 3XL and 4XL are still the daily drivers for my In-laws. They have no complaints.
8 months with issues
My P3 and my P6 both easily lasted three years and were still going strong when I traded them in.  I have every reason to believe they had another couple of years in them.

My P1 is still trucking along today (albeit with a battery that is mostly shot).
I believe there is not so much of a difference in longevity between the 2. And compared to s24 I believe my pixel 9 takes better pictures, but idk about s25
I just got a new Pixel 7 pro, and experience zero lags in running apps, the photo processing does take a little time if you have a big burst but that's no issue to me.  I have a tough case and indend for it to last 2 years.
Re. photos, the biggest difference between google and samsung is google does a great job of freezing subjects that should not be blurry in a resulting photo while samsung falls flat on its face (and also I believe shots in lower lighting look better on my pixels than samsungs).

Longevity--what will you do with your phone?  While google has improved their tensor from the original in the pixel 6, the pixel 9 still suffers from poor thermal management (does not have the advanced cooling implementation that the 9 pro has), and if you game you will probably experience the worse GPU performance of the tensor compared to the S25 (personally my 8 pro would slow to a crawl on some games; I haven't play much in the way of games on my 9 pro xl though).  

So overall usage scenarios, in my opinion, is a much bigger thing to consider than just longevity.  I'm not saying don't get the pixel 9--I opted for a 9 pro xl coming from an S23 ultra and I prefer it--but there's more to consider.

Related: I still have my pixel 4 xl, which I now use as a home device for my company work, because they require MDM and I don't want it running on my daily phone.  My 4 xl performs well still.  Battery life isn't good, but it never was.  That being said, I feel like the SD855 was a really robust workhorse and always performed well.
They promise 5 years I think. You should get 2 years forsure, after that battery may need to be replaced. Expect about 1000 charge cycles from the battery
My Pixel 8a is still going well after 8 months highly recommended.
I'm always confused what people do with their devices to get them to lag? I haven't seen a flagship phone in literal years that started lagging in day to day tasks just from using it. Are people out there running their devices into the ground or something? 

That being said, Pixel phones are great these days. The 9 series is definitely their best effort in years. The modem is finally up to par, the camera is what you expect from a Pixel, the software is one of the smoothest UI experiences out there. Despite what people on Reddit like to say, the Tensor chip does just fine with 99% of things. Yeah it isn't going to beat a Qualcomm for video rendering and things like that, but it is a well optimized processor at this point. I easily can get a couple of days battery life from the 9 Pro XL.
As I'm \_still\_ fine with the performance of the Pixel 5 (used it until summer '24 and now my daughter uses it), I'm quite sure my 9 Pro will be fine in 5-6 years if I can replace the battery..😅

Caveat: I don't really use it for gaming.
Recently had an dxte ded warranty claim denied for dubious reasons on my pixel 8, never thought I'd switch but I'm seriously considering it.
I had the 4 for maybe 3 years.  I loved the 4.  But the battery started swelling.  I thought that was early myself.  Replaced it with the 8a.  Hate this 8a.  I have had it for a few months.  The screen is already cracked and I thought I would replace it when it got bad, but now I've decided I'll replace the entire phone most likely.
Pixels earned a reputation for being great camera phones for photography but since Pixel 7,  the rest of the industry has caught up. 

And Pixels are now lagging behind in low light performance, portrait and video. The hardware is literally 2 or more generations behind the latest phones.
I'm not going to remember how long I ran each phone, but I started forever ago with a Pixel XL, then think I went with the Pixel 3, then the 5 and just upgraded to the 9 Pro.  Nothing ever stopped working, but between lagging over time and battery degradation ... Loving my 9 Pro right now.
I have a pixel 7 pro and it's held up surprisingly well. The volume rocker popped off and I replaced it with an eBay but but other than that no issues.

I might replace it in the next year but this is the longest I've held onto a phone for some time.

Last daily was a Samsung s23 ultra but had to make a change because Samsung kept breaking it with bad software updates.
Now they have 7 years support, so best value ever. Google also tries to prove that just with software you can have mediocre hardware behaving like actually having very good hardware. Pixel have the best camera results with worse camera setup, and better battery life than lots of phones with a lot bigger battery.

My experience with pixels is almost flawless, all little software exclusives are for me killer features. Can't go back to any other phones
My pixel 7 pro crashes constantly with apps like photos, Instagram, Google drive(if looking at pics), Facebook, even after clearing cache, etc. 

I've heard Google got their sh*t together with pixel 9 and it's a good phone. S24 and s25 are pretty much the same phone, Galaxy is hardly updating their phones, unless you get the ultra. The main difference will be AI use. If you need a powerhouse go with Galaxy ultra 24 or 25, otherwise the pixel camera doesn't have shutter lag and arguable takes better pics ( but 24 does but 25 might not).

Honestly I'd wait for review of 25
I am happy with the 6 pro. Play alot of games on it so the battery should be replaced soon but the phone is fine otherwise.
My brother is still using the Pixel 2 XL he bought the year it came out (2017) even though he has a Pixel 8 Pro.  The phone is still in excellent condition, works without problems.  My brother likes this phone because of the cool speakers compared to other Pixels.  The battery capacity remained around 70%.
Personal experience, I've gone from the 4a to the 6, and I'm waiting for the 10 to release.

The battery on the 4a was puffing when I replaced it, I've replaced the battery once on my 6. 

The 6 still feels fine doing daily tasks and playing random games. Longevity seems fine to me. Hopefully that helps.
I've seen the longevity of my Pixel 7pro in other ways. Pixel dropped from 3 meters high onto stone. It had a thin silicone case. And survived. Most of all, I noticed how sturdy Pixel is built. Not even camera lenses are damaged.
Define snappiness. 

You don't sound like the kind of user who will have issues with this. The main complainants of Pixels seem to be gamers.
I got 3 years out of my original pixel and 4 years out of the pixel 5. Just upgraded to the 9 Pro & I love it.
I just got my Pixel 9 pro xl. It's my first Google phone, before this I had Samsung A52. I am absolutely blown away with Pixel and how integrated Google is, the camera is top notch. I expect to get many years out of it!
I had an iPhone 13 that wouldnt hold a charge after 3 years. The Pixel 9 will be good for a long time.  As good as an iPhone at least! 😉

Its like a horror show.
My grandmother is still using my pixel 4 and it runs really well for its age. It doesn't feel old at all. Its a 5 year old phone known for being the worst pixel ever made.
I replaced a Pixel 2 with a Pixel 6 only because T-Mobile was did anding to their network so the Pixel 2 would no longer be compatible, or so at the said. Though by the end the camera was having problems and battery life was not so great. I sill have the Pixel 6. It still works fine, and does everything I need it to do. I hope to get at least another year or two out of it.
I had the S22 and the camera seems to be the same on the S25 and it kinda suck

Cant really say much more since S25 isn't even out yet lol
I was too until this most recent update and now it's killed my battery. Google customer support has been just about useless for 2 weeks straight now. I would not recommend a pixel to anyone now. Check out the pixel 4 sub if anyone doubts this, you'll see all kinds of horror stories
Me too! I gave mine to my kid and still running smooth and perfect battery. And pix4a has arguably the worst battery hardware for the last 6 years.
My mother-in-law has a Pixel 3 that I gave her 3 years ago. Damn thing is still working perfectly and she won't let us get her a new phone. She loves it.
I had the Pixel 6 and after that the pixel 7. Apart from the really good video and photo quality these phones are the worst I had in my life. Bad battery life, subpar performance, bugs, bad design etc.
I also hat the early nexus phones and I would say, the hype with the pixel phones is absolutely not justified.
Yeah I have been doing trade offs for days now. Honestly at this point I feel like ordering them both, testing myself and returning one back.

I actually already pre ordered the S25 due to a sweet deal but having 2nd thoughts.

Maybe you can throw your 2 cents, I had a choice between the following:

1. S25 512 GB + watch 7 - 600 EUR
2. P9 256 GB - 600 EUR
3. P9 Pro 256 GB + pixel watch 3 - 860 EUR

What do you reckon is a good deal? I initially thought, well obviously the S25, double the storage, good SoC and a relatively decent smartwatch, and a decent camera system.
Hmm, I'm having issues not getting notifications from the SimpliSafe app. But no others that I've noticed. Wonder if it's related?
All of us 4a users are out here angry lol.
Did you see this post about how to determine which battery you have. If you can replace the battery and verify that it has the good serial number you could be in the clear. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixel4a/comments/1idpgnn/determine\_if\_your\_battery\_is\_impacted\_by\_battery/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixel4a/comments/1idpgnn/determine_if_your_battery_is_impacted_by_battery/)
Ya I updated my 6 pro to a 9 pro this year, but it was only because I was in the rare position to get myself something nice for Christmas and that's what I decided to get.  The 6 never had an issue the whole time I owned it, and still runs great.  Not even any battery issues.  I was over 3 years with it.
They're not alone though. Samsung just released 2 years old camera hardware.
I tend to agree. We saw the same with Apple before when they had the lowest ram (and still do) but made it work.

As for software alone, unfortunately in Europe some of the fancy tricks don't work.
I am eagerly waiting for reviews but I also have S25 on pre order. it ships mid Feb so I have plenty of time to still cancel it or return if the camera is that horrible. Pixel 9 is readily available for the same price but half the storage.
Not waiting around for apps to load. You know when you open YouTube for example, it'll just pop to the home screen with videos waiting to be viewed or hang a few moments in the loading animation.

Or when panning around in maps. Smooth panning vs choppy.

Indeed, I don't play games. The most intensive task i would do is 4k recording or maps navigation in the heat of summer.
Same situation for me, I've been using Pixel 4a since 2020 and everything was great I took care of the phone and kept it in a case and tempered glass screen protector. My phone is still in pristine condition with no cracks or any scratches, it's fully functional until the update. Now I can't use my phone without keeping it plugged in and if I take the charger off the battery lasts about 1-2 hours. So I took the $50 that Google offered me and bought a OnePlus 13R, now I can use the phone for 2 days before I need to charge it again. Would not recommend any pixel devices to anyone now after what they did with my Pixel 4a.
Same but I flashed to the old version and it's back to normal. You might want to try that (or a different OS)

I still wouldn't rec a pixel for longevity now though, the fact that they pulled this in the first place is ridiculous.
Same thing with 7a.. I have this phone for 20 months, it's great for that price but in the last cca 30 days battery dies really quickly: Like phone is on 25% then in 5min it's already on 10% and from then you can literally see battery dropping from 10 to 0% in like.. 6s max.. So so annoying. I guess some newer patch fucked something up or I don't know what the problem is
If it didn't start to slow/stop getting security updates I would have kept it too. 😂
Not experienced any of that as someone who's had the 6 pro since launch, it's easily the best phone I've ever had lol 

I could have gone for another phone after my original 6 pro broke from me being an idiot with it, but I decided to just get another 6 pro, not giving up this beauty any time soon
Bummer. I've only had great experience with battery. I'm sure it definitely depends on how you use your phone and what you do with it, too.
I really like Pixel call screening and the stock android so it's hard to let that go but I think the galaxy watch 7 is probably the better watch (not by much though).  I also prefer a smaller phone and the s25 base is a little smaller than the base P9. I honestly wouldn't even consider the P9 pro it's just too big for me.

I am a fitbit user and the equipment at my gym shares data to Fitbit so I have a lot of history with that as well. Some of the equipment like the life fitness treadmills will also share to Samsung health so that would be ok but then I have to open two apps to compare my old data to my new data unless there is some way to transfer stuff between the two. I have no idea about that. 

If you are considering the bundles the s25 would win out for me. It just seems like the better deal. If you have the means to get them both and decide with them in hand that is always a great option. You never know it could come down to something silly like a glitchy fingerprint scanner.
Yes, we are fuming everywhere rn, as Google refuses to give us an explanation of any sort. I used to suggest everyone to get a Pixel but now I am the one telling them to avoid after experiencing their service first hand. :)
For nothing. It’s an old battery. Google is being shady, but again it’s a 4 year old battery
As expected, mine has a faulty one, ...501
I forgot the pixel 9 has 16gb ram compared to s25 12, so there's an upside there. Good luck !
I don't think you will have issues there in a few years time then. Especially with the 7 year support cycle and YT and Google Maps being one of their own too, they will be focusing on them working well together.
You know that P9 PRO is the exact same size as P9, right? (6,3"") 
The Pro XL is bigger, not the regular pro (wich I'm currently owning).
I don't agree. They basically pushed malware on us. And not every battery is 4 years old. It seems that there are two manufacturers of the batteries and one is faulty and the other is ok. Even a newly replaced battery from the defective manufacturer has battery life significantly reduced. There are a lot less destructive ways that this could have been handled. I just saw instructions on how to find the serial number of the battery on reddit and which would have been negatively impacted. Google could have just told us about the problem and had us check which batteries we have and replaced the bad ones instead of rendering them unusable. This would have probably preserved a lot of the inventory of 4a batteries making repair faster and easier. Instead they did what they did. Every company has problems eventually. The fact that we've had to sus this all out ourselves as users says a lot about google.
I didn't actually but they're both too big really and too heavy. S25 saves like 1.3 oz. and is way more comparable to my much loved pixel 4a. I kind of check out at the $999 msrp with the same chipset as the regular 9.  Not sure what you get for the extra money. What made you choose the 9pro?
I've said it many times already, but here we go again: This device is, and was for a long time already, end of life.


It is no longer intended to be used on the daily due to security reasons alone. The Pixel 4a is stuck on Android 13. That is 2, soon 3 major OS versions behind. Do not use such insecure phone and take the manufacturer's word on when it is time to switch. More modern Pixels have an EOL in around 7 years. If something happens BEFORE that, fine - we can talk. But otherwise, Google is perfectly in the right with that one.
Better screen resolution, 4 more gb of ram, ultra-wide sensor on camera :) 

Since I'm planning to keep it as much as I can, I just picked the one wich seemed more future proof
It's not about just the update. They refused to give us a clear explanation. Even if people changed their battery a few days ago before the update, it got bricked. Even if they are offering free replacement they are charging for random things, for many people they are not allowing to club the $100 credit if a phone is on sale. Not many people change their phone every 2-3 years. And most of them never had issues like this.

Tell me ""know it all"", why Older pixels like 3 or 4a 5g didn't have any issues?

Google is just trying to keep their image, if the phone bursts cause of a manufacturing defect they don't wanna be held responsible for it, and it is a manufacturing defect, otherwise why only phones with certain build numbers and battery from a certain manufacturer got bricked?

Stop licking ass of the big tech companies.
The 4a was released like 4 years and 5 months ago or something? EOL means no new updates not that they update the phone with malware that makes it totally unusable. I think I would have rather they held to their EOL plans and not released any update at all. Honestly, it's more like they went out of their way to brick these phones than anything if you consider that. Phone is old so it's ok for them to forcibly render it unusable via mandatory software update is kind of a wild take.
I used to be more of a go cheaper and upgrade more often but since the 4a it seems like nobody makes what I want anymore and everything seems like a subjective downgrade.
> why Older pixels like 3 or 4a 5g didn't have any issues?


That has absolutely nothing to do with the current situation? Your entire argument is based on the speculation of there being a manufacturing defect which is not supported by any facts whatsoever. What is factually known though is the Pixel 4a being an officially unsupported device.


Them pushing an update for it way past it's EOL is unusual enough.


My main point being, if a device stopped receiving updates for over 1 YEAR (!!), you shouldn't use it anymore no matter what's happening to the battery. No security patches for a device you carry around the entire day - in possibly private and intimate moments - is reason enough to move on.


That has nothing to do with licking anyone's ass but rather not exposing yourself to exploits when you very well just couldn't. If you're not okay with the EOL of a device in the first place, buy one that is supported for longer. If money is tight, second-hand Pixel 7as are available for fairly affordable prices on Marketplace sites.",2025-01-30 16:03:59,37,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1idqa41/longevity_of_pixel_phones/

what brick and cord are using? not all are created equal (quality wise).
If charging optimization is enabled it will slow charge during your sleep period as this minimizes wear and tear on your battery. My pixels have been doing this since Android 14. 

If you want after hours fast charge look into turning it off.

I have an Anker 100w charger and even though Google says it doesn't support more than what's advertised my devices seem to charge faster on it
Hi there, could you check the charging port area for any dust or debris that might be interfering?

Additionally, you can reach out to the Google Pixel support team via phone or chat [here](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/gethelp). They can take a look at it.

Disable adaptive battery under battery saver bottom options. Doesn't completely resolve the issue, but it definitely helps for the majority of apps. I still get some delayed notifications but not nearly as bad as before. Also the battery life doesn't seem to take a hit.

I keep my car outside with just a windshield sun cover, so temps inside the car can be 150°F (65°C)+ when I get in. I've been pretty happy with my Pixel 7a, but it becomes completely unusable inside of my car, and especially so when it's connected to Android Auto. I don't know if I can manage another summer with the 7a, and I'm wondering if the 9 Pro is a lot more tolerating of the heat.

Comments:
Phones ain't meant to be left in direct sunlight ever
It will probably be better than the 7a but that temperature is outside the operating range for the phone:  https://search.app/XsPJJ2ySMJHRK5kRA
I live in central TX, and it's pretty darn hot for good chunks of the year. My 9 Pro does better than my old 7 Pro, but it still struggles if I try to charge it in the car in the heat.  My solution was to aim an AC vent at the phone.
My Pixel 8 in Indian summers(peaking at 47c) was boiling at 43c battery temp the second I go outside.
And yes the 7a, 8a, 7 and 6 can’t handle it. Go for 9 Pro pls
It runs much cooler than previous generations. It'll do better than the 7a.
What you can try is go to settings>system>reset option> reset app preferences.And then restart your mobile.

It will reset any app which is getting your location or running in background for useless reason.Then you can run apps which are required from scratch.
OnePlus 13 is IP 69 rating meaning you can cool it off with cold water no problem plus the vapor chamber inside the 13 is pretty large. Might be time to switch brands if Google doesn't work for you.
Pixel 7a's don't run hot like the regular Pixel 7.",2025-01-29 22:20:16,3,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1id6e1x/how_does_the_pixel_9_pro_hold_up_in_extreme_heat/
GooglePixel,"Tried to switch from iPhone 16 Pro to Pixel 9 Pro, not successful","Hey,

As context, my first smartphone was an android, then switched to iphone 4 and went back to androids (oneplus and xiaomi) then switched to iphone 6 (before the 13 came out) and since the 13 mini I started using only iphones (upgrading every year, yes (never had to spend more money to upgrade)), now having the iPhone 16 Pro

Recently I've wanted to do more with my phone (particularly with automations) and was finding iOS to be limited (as I always knew). I was very sceptical but decided to just give it a shot for a week atleast.

Today I received it and went through the migration process etc, there were some quirks but to be expected, especially with Google Account and Gemini integration. Then i saw that when you **restart** the phone, you **lose all notifications**.... why? how is that something that happens with no way of fixing...

Still kept trying it until I went to play some audio on Spotify... and damn the audio is complete garbage for a high end phone... And I did try Youtube videos and just playing audio on the browser and the same experience happened. That was enough for me to decide to not switch over to the Pixel.  
Took me 3 hours... Im actually very disappointed never expected for the audio to be the deciding factor.

Even comparing with the Samsung you can see such a big difference in a Youtube video (imagine in person): [https://youtu.be/DnvbAAKlT3s?si=XcRs\_gcuN5AL2V38&t=540](https://youtu.be/DnvbAAKlT3s?si=XcRs_gcuN5AL2V38&t=540)

The end, love you all <3 

PS: for those who like the audio on the Pixel, everyone has different preferences and this is mine.

Comments:
No audio issues here on my end.
>Then i saw that when you **restart** the phone, you **lose all notifications**....

Notifications are persistent between reboots.
Surprised that notification persistence is a big deal for you. I rarely restart my phone
Do you mean audio via the device's speaker, or through headphones?
I have a Pixel 4 still and it's fine for me, I came from an iPhone.
Did a quick search on google at the time and asked my brother who is an android user to test and in both (from what I found) no one said they were. The only thing I found was apps that would recreate those notifications.  
Is there a setting that you changed? (that I did not find)  
(edit) also I saw some apps would keep them, but it depends on the app and the developer of it.
Im a very ""out of sight out of mind"" person unfortunately, so notifications help me not forget stuff. I don't expect to restart the phone either but I felt it was such a basic thing not to happen.
The device's speaker
I have the 9P and 3a! The 3a had water damage, had to replace the screen but the speakers still are bumpin even after water damage.
If there are some poorly developed apps, you can always access your past notifications in the notification history shade. Most of those notifications are also actionable and directly put you into the target location or action.
Did your Android give you your notification history? 

Turn that on and you'll have all your notifications saved to access always.
you might have the most niche use case I have ever seen.  I don't know anyone that uses a phone speaker for music or restarts their phone routinely
I saw that and I actually liked that cause it could help me remember stuff that I might have dismissed, but the notification itself after reboot would still disappear from the ""notification screen"". Sure I could check it in the history still.  
Either way thanks for the tip!
Not sure why this is such a big thing. I mean i hardly restart my phone but if it's a big deal for you then it's your choice",2025-01-29 21:17:57,0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1id4wj2/tried_to_switch_from_iphone_16_pro_to_pixel_9_pro/
GooglePixel,Why is the Pixel 9 cheaper on Amazon than Google's store?,"Pixel 9

Google store: $799

Amazon: $719



Comments:
It's sold by ElectroDealz LLC, not Google.
It’s authorized dealers. They buy the phones in bulk from Google for at 60-70% cost and have a 30-40% margin for profit. They discount usually 10-15% and still make a little to move units.
The phones are always more expensive at Google because they are factoring in and averaging out the difference in trade in prices.  Make the prices higher so the trade in value seems greater than it is while not losing on profit.

Similar to a deal at the grocery store for toilet paper that is $19.99 down to $9.99 when before the sale it was originally $15.99.

It's a little different but a similar concept.
It might be cheaper with a trade-in deal, which you can't usually take advantage of at Amazon. For example when I bought my phone it had a huge trade-in value for my old phone, also there was a free gift card for the Google store. Amazon had a lower price for the straight up phone, and gave a gift card, but nowhere close to the trade-in value.

There's different stuff to weigh depending on your needs. You can also check Best Buy as well to see if they have a better deal.

Otherwise, its likely the same phone, each store offers better discounts every once in a while. Just check the storage and make sure it isn't locked to a particular carrier and you are fine.

Also, sometimes your carrier will have a better deal. Like Verizon at one point was giving the phone away for free with any of their unlimited plans.

Hope this helps!
Because Amazon is a flea market with a good decorator.
Just a funny joke billionaires play on each other
Google sell products higher price than their distributors because they need distribution. If they sell lower or even equal, they are basically compete with the distributors and no one wants to sell products for them.
Is it actually that cheap? I paid $1100 for my P8 pro.
Different stores have different prices? Say it ain't so!
Who is the seller?
Because Google pays credit for purchases, so it evens out or actually works out cheaper if you're a Google One member
Bro just found out today how the market economy works lol
Most things are a bit cheaper on Amazon
3rd party not amazon. and they might be trying to get rid of stock? or selling refurb units.
No trade ins
Its generally a bad idea to buy phones on Amazon. You might get a lemon, you might get an open box, or you might just get an empty box. Even if it is legit, your driver might put it in the wrong spot, or someone might porch pirate it. 

Don't be foolish. Buy it in person, or from a proper retailer and have it sent to a secure location.
Google trade in is dope, got my pro out the door for like $600, traded a 6a and used a promo code for 10% I found on Reddit
Is that more or less trustworthy than TotallyNotaScam LLC?
odd thing i noticed is that on a electronics store (with physical locations you can go and try things before buying, they're still cheaper than on Google's website 


odd
So what you're saying is: buy 1000 Pixel phones to get a 40% discount, then sell the other 999 at 90% of the retail price, invest the profit into the next batch of 1000 Pixel phones, repeat the process, and basically infinite money?
Very true.  That said, Google Store does price match a few major retailers like Best Buy and Amazon if you ask.  Last Nov I got the P9 for $549 via price match and traded in my P8 for $490.
How many rolls of toilet paper do you get for $19?
Yep, carriers often have way better deals. I just bought a Pixel 9 from Mint Mobile for $400. A really great deal considering they only lock phones for 60 days.
Also I'm only aware of being able to get 5% off with amazon prime storecard, while with google one you get 10% back, that extra 5% on 720 is 36$ which covers much of the 80$ difference.

Another possibility is there's some tax shenanigans here... buy in a state with no sales tax, then resell on amazon?  Buy in bulk get cheaper prices?  Who knows...
At the Google Store, if you're not in a hurry you can string together trade-ins, store credits & sale prices for some good deals. The Pixel 9 Pro was on sale & I wanted it. With the P9P sale price plus my trade-in, I got the previously unaffordable P9P for $300. A Google Store credit came with the purchase. A few months later, that credit covered the price of a Fitbit Charge 6 which (of course) was on sale.  I couldn't afford the phone & had no use for the store credit, but in the end, I got a Pixel 9 Pro plus a Fitbit Charge 6 for $300.
They're also selling these same phones at the same prices in physical retail stores that are in some of the most expensive parts of the country (Mountain View, New York) - ie. you have Silicon Valley / New York sales staff labor costs vs an online retailer's from near the middle-of-nowhere.
It's the non-pro, non-xl, 128gb (not 256gb) model = ie. the utter base model.
I don't trust any place that substitutes S's with Z's.
I actually have purchased a used phone from them, via backmarket.com. no complaints
I'd trust both of them over Google with how Google has handled this 4a debacle 
Just remember, doing this means interacting with the standard level consumer.  Madness and confusion are common side effects.
How do you ask on the google store?
I don't know bud it's just an example.....go to the grocery store and ask👍
Just don't eat from Pissa Hut
Plus you're not guaranteed to make a profit... you might end up with unsold inventory if it doesn't actually sell, you may end up dumping below purchase cost to try to recoup... etc...  plus you have to handle returns, advertising, etc.  It's not quite such a simple money maker...
https://support.google.com/store/answer/9631873?hl=en 

Or use chat support.

The tricky part is they have to see the competitor price live (can't be a screenshot) and the phone has to have shipped  which can take a couple days sometimes.

Since prices change all the time, what I did was chat with them as soon as I ordered the phone so they could see the competitor price right then and there, and then they made a note on my account to apply the credit once the phone shipped (I just had to email the rep back when that happened).  Not all reps will do it so it might take a couple tries.
Is this where all that CP sex dungeons the Dems were involved with was at? 

/s if it wasn't obvious
Yep, I still have TracFone SUN phones, they are 3G android 4 phones that I got for $5 each 8+ years ago, pretty much worthless.  The shit camera and wifi means I can even recycle them to other thing like security cameras, clocks, weather stations etc.  Did manage to sell of about 90% of my inventory, even some of it at cost.

GooglePixel,P7P Broken SIM Tray Trade In,"Hi everyone! I was doing the Google store trade in to swap my Pixel 7 Pro for a new Pixel 9. It was a great deal since I had a coupon code, only about 100 bucks after trade in. 

I got my phone and was swapping over all the stuff, and when I used the SIM ejector tool to remove the SIM the top just popped out and the  SIM is just stuck in the phone! I hardly touched it beyond inserting the tool, I never even had a chance to pull the card out. 

Now my old SIM is stuck in my phone and I'm worried that it won't be eligible for trade in, since I have a busted SIM tray and there's a SIM card stuck in it! 

Any thoughts or advice? Has anyone experienced this before?

Thanks! 

Small edit: I ordered a replacement from ubreakifix but still need to get my old SIM out of the device.

GooglePixel,Exclusive: Google Pixel 9a Exact Release Date Finally Revealed - It's Coming Soon!,"

Comments:
>According to a source, Google will start pre-orders for Pixel 9a on March 19. The devices will begin to ship on March 26. Pixel 9a will also be available in-store starting on March 26.
If only the 9A had the same size as the 4A would be great
Yesterday I upgraded from 7a to 8a. Well done myself.
I had a 6a and a 7a, but I went to the 9 Pro (mainly for the camera and faster charging rate), and I've been very happy.
I forgot about the potential flushed camera lenses which I really like.  I am still going to wait for the Pixel 10 announcement, but if that is crazy expensive, I might have to go for this.
That's *quick*.

Pixel 10 must be ahead of schedule, then. Probably going to release June/July, which looks like it coincides with the [release schedule](https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Android-16-Beta-release-timeline.jpg.webp) of stable Android 16.

Per [*Android Authority*](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-release-date-3495817/):

> Although Google hasn’t shared the exact date for the stable launch, a leak suggests Android 16 could be ready by June 3. This report claims that Google will be ready to roll out Android 16 on the date, simultaneously delivering the source to AOSP and releasing updates for Pixel devices. Keep in mind that this date could be pushed back if Google happens to run into a snag during development.
Hopefully a good trade in deal comes for P6 owners like myself. I haven't upgraded cuz my P6 is chugging along just fine, but wouldn't mind a newer device now that this one is 4 years old.
I like the bigger battery and the lack of camera lense bump.
499$ for 9a?

Currently, the pixel 9 costs ~599$ in Germany.

I bet the normal G P9 will cost the same at retail till this will be released.
Leaks so rampant that we’re in the end stretch before Google officially teased this thing, lol
Coming soon... with a price hike for some versions...
Hopefully 10a will be 6.1'' again.
Is this still rumored to have the Pixel 8 modem?
Nah gonna wait out 10a and hopefully it has the new pixel 10 chip TSMC.
Is the 9a the smaller cheaper version of the 9?
Do we know if it'll have UWB or not?
That means there's going to be sales for the Pixel 8 in 2 months?
I'm still tryna get the 9 PRO (Non-XL) and still no solid deal from my carrier (Rogers - CAN)
Full of bugs, im sure
> 6.28"" display so it will still be a pretty small phone

[Excuse me](https://tenor.com/view/2stupid-dogs-big-dog-little-big-mr-hollywood-well-aint-that-cute-gif-17156303)
Google is playing smart. Consumers caught on to the strategy of waiting until Black Friday for discounts, which limited the window for charging full price during the initial excitement of a new release. Now, by adjusting their pricing approach, they can maintain higher prices for several months before offering traditional holiday discounts.
I'm late to the news.. ""Google will start pre-orders for Pixel 9a on **March 19**."" I have been waiting for Google to give me a phone that looked like my Pixel 4a 5G so now I'm going straight to the 9a. I'm concerned about the modem. I'm really hoping they've worked out the bugs that everyone's been talking about.🤞 I can't wait for these reviewers (especially 9to5 Google) to get their hands on this device. Over this next month we will get their verdict.
Why would I buy this if Google wants to delete its mobile device team?
Huge pixel fan. I was planning to upgrade to pixel 8a once Pixel 9a comes (price drop expectations). But I am not buying any more pixels due to what they have done to my pixel 4a by battery appeasement scheme. An update ruined the mobile and now they are offering appeasement policy to pacify the users world over. But at the cost of phone being made dead.
Pre-owned Pixel 8a for 550$CAD now or should I wait for the 9a?
do we know if this phone is still going to be gimped with the old modem?
Just so everyone is aware, this device will use the same problematic modem as the Pixel 8 allegedly. That makes it DoA imo
After what they recently did to Pixel 4a users, I'm definitely steering clear
Why should i buy pixel? Give me reasons 
Best screen in samsung best battery in samsung
Best durability in samsung 
And if not samsung; iphone is there so why pixel which no google photos unlimited storage like previous one
Thanks, saved me a click! 🙏
They said it's usually around Google I/O.  But that's usually in late May.  So hard to trust those dates
Any chance there will be a sale during that period? 😮
Yeah, I really don't get it, they make the A series a sort of lesser clone of what they released 6 months before instead of going after a different kind of user... Like you I want a compact midrange with great camera, light and robust. I just don't get undercutting their own sales 6 months in with a too similar release... Anyhow my 5 is still going strong and meets my needs. Thank fuck for that.
Smh this 8 pro needs to go. Came from a iPhone 12 pro smaller version and I want to go back to something small but with a pro version at least 145 with no bezels common Google are hands don't get bigger as we age
I wish the 9a had the same size of the XL 🤷🏻
Thanks for your sacrifice.
Why? 7A is still great phone.. any big change?
Nonsense
How's reception compared to 6a.
Still hoping the wireless charging will be faster than on the 8a.
Yes but our prices across Europe include VAT, take that out of the equation as US prices never include VAT as it varies from state to state and even county to county in a state, puts it at ~$480.
Or 8pro for 500 Euro also in Germany
Yes but it'll probably coke with more ""advanced ai solutions"" that noone asked for
I hear that the Pixel 12 is the one to really wait for, let them get the bugs out of the first couple of generations of the TSMC chips.
Same size.
Cheaper, maybe unless you look for deals. If you're with mint mobile you can get one (edit: 9) for 399, before the holidays It was 299 .
actually it's bigger because of the bigger bezels
Same here, looking forward to the 9a. Still going to miss the headphone jack though.
It'll have Tensor G4, I'd be very surprised if Google manufactured new Tensor G4 SoC's with an older modem.
What problems? My P8 seems fine
Inb4 it keeps beating sales records year after year
Has this been confirmed?
At least the battery is larger 🤷‍♂️
And the Pixel 7. Exynos 5300 has been around a while. Hopefully they've worked out all the bugs, but they're offering one of the best modems in the P9 and one of the worst in the 9a. 
I've never been in an area where the signal on my Pixel 8 was noticably worse than other manufacturers' phones.
What did they do?
Give $50 to people who bought a $300 device 4.5 years ago? Don't get me wrong, I'm pissed that they neutered my favorite phone in 12 years, but I have to give credit that they didn't just ignore it or shut the devices off outright. 
*give me reasons*

No.
Remember travellers, never feed the trolls.
Wrong sub
Why should I spend an extra 300-700 for a galaxy?

The era of ranting about specs and better performance needs to go away already. None of it matters when all we do is doom scroll, pay bills and follow people who don't give a crap about us  on these phones.
But then you clicked reply on his comment. And again to submit. Now you're down a click. Checkmate.
There's a chance they bumped the release date up 2 months like they did with the 9 which would line up
Google has been doing everything they can to grab attention from Apple lately so they most likely moved up the date to beat Apple to market with Pixel 9a since the iPhone SE4/16E will be huge problem for Google.
Sales show people prefer big screens and if they can they'll buy luxury/premium versions too.  
  
The 9a is a big-screened phone with the same chipset and design language as the flagship phones (just like the 3 last ""a"" phones), and even though Google doesn't share sales numbers I'm pretty sure they beat sales records year after year on every model, including the ""a"" model.  
  
What I'm trying to say is, I don't think there's any model undercutting going on.  You call the ""a"" a lesser clone, while most users see it as budget premium
That's why I got the P9P I hate it for the flat sides and prefer the rounded back of the P8 though. Wish there was a P8 shape with pro cameras and RAM
Haha, I agree. I had a bulging battery, so getting a new phone was a necessity. No hard feelings on my end—except toward the insurance I got the 7a from. They refuse to provide me with the bill they received, which means I can't apply for a warranty with Google.
It has an upgraded modem so connection is very good compared to previous gens
I live in  an area with really good coverage, so it's tough to tell
Even wired charging... 18W in 2025 is pathetic
AFAIK even the highest sales tax in the US is still under 10% (although rumors are there might be a new 50% surcharge on select items).  
  
Furthermore the 10% Google One store benefit (I'm not sure which countries this is available in, but definitely in the US) and credit card cashback (easily 1.5%, can be 2%) actually reduces actual out-of-pocket cost below pre-tax cost - so you can sort of ignore the tax more or less.
European prices are similar to US prices with VAT. So the difference to current GP9 would be less
I hear pixel 20 will be amazing
I recently upgraded to the 9 Pro, but I miss the size of my old 5.   Such a great phone.

It sure didn't make sense when the rumor came out, so yeah Ive been waiting on conformation that it was bunk.
It's whatever, people love to call 99% of phones DoA because it doesn't fit their particular needs

This is why I'm moving to Graphene OS
What’s your reason to buy a pixel??
If that's all you do on the phone, there is no reason to pay the Google tax, spending double what a phone should cost so that Google can keep it's profit margins atmospheric.
Well most of you do maybe i don’t
I was going to say the same thing, you saved me a click, thanks!
[deleted]
lets hope!
It's not that people don't want to buy small phones it's just they want the best bang for buck and that's usually the larger phone. The iPhone 16/16 Pro are proof people still love medium small devices.
Now this is just a personal opinion and extremely nitpicky, but I would honestly call the Pixel A-series more premium budget than budget premium, hahah. 
But that's just me haha.
I think they would make a killing if they had a different phone and it would re-premiumize their flagships... Anyhow not like my 2 cents are worth anything...
Yeah I'm def going for the 9 pro or 10 when I get the chance I love the phone look and internals just how tall it is it's hard to handle 
I have the 9, reception definitely seems better to me than my 6 pro
The 9 (made an edit)

In the app go to Account > shop new phones. It's currently $399

9 Xl is $699 as well.
Thank you kindly! Not sure if it's DoA, but close unless you're coming from something older than a 6a.
Oh thats why my battery is failing fucking hell
But then you clicked reply on his comment. And again to submit. Now you're down a click.
And it's nice to be nice
That's fair
Smaller phones are for people who would otherwise buy someone else's phone or no phone at all. They're the lowest profit margin device, so if they cannibalize sales from a P9, Google loses $300+.

But I have small hands 😭
I haven't really been keeping tabs on the 9 but from a quick search.

9 has more ram (12 vs 8), 9a has a bigger battery (5100 vs 4700 mah)

The rest seems to be about the same. 
Did see something about the 9a having a modified sensor 4 chip.
After 60 days it becomes unlocked.

Edit: https://www.mintmobile.com/help/what-is-mint-mobiles-phone-unlock-policy/
Oh, I have large hands and still prefer them. I also prefer small cars. Sadly, everything's a phablet and an SUV these days.
Also big person with mammoth hands. Love small phones (can I get a modem Xperia Z3 Compact) and drive a Honda Jazz/fit.

If I want a giant screen I'll use a tablet (and still prefer smaller tablets I kept my Nexus 7 for years)
They can take my Toyota 86 from my cold, dead hands.

I just want to take a normal photo of me with natural light, but this thing seems to use the sun as the standard for brightness and every photo I take turns out like complete ass. Any suggestions on how to fix the camera to be normal? 

Comments:
Turn off ultra HDR in camera settings. 
Alternatively, use the settings icon on the bottom right corner of the camera app and adjust the picture with those tools.
I thought complete ass was good for Tinder.
Nope! I love the images and the video this thing makes.
The camera is likely not the problem....

There isn't a single reviewer or professional out there, that would tell you the pixel takes bad pictures.
Dynamic exposure algorithm. Every pixel in the picture has its own exposure, which is why it looks fake, and not the way your eye would see it (the eyeball itself captures light  in single-exposure). Disable HDR and you'll get a more ""filmic"" look 
Yeah, they're horrible. I don't like the grading of photos on Pixel at all, I've yet to take a photo with front or rear camera that I haven't had to edit as they look so bright and soulless

GooglePixel,Google Pixel 9 Pro Issues With Car Bluetooth,"Hello fellow Pixel lovers! I just made the switch from Samsung for over a decade to a new Pixel 9 pro phone. I love it so far, other than one thing: it bugs the hell out of my car bluetooth. I've searched and saw many issues with these phones and bluetooth, however mine seems to be unique. I'm hoping someone has some advice about this. I have NO issue connecting to bluetooth, playing music, etc. That all works fine. I have a 2019 Honda Civic SI and use Honda Link to connect my phone.

The issue is, I get text message alerts over and over and over again, from texts in the past. For example, I got a text last night at 9pm. Today on the drive into work, I got the alert for this text on my screen every 10 seconds the entire drive. If I hit ""read"", nothing happens (it usually reads the text message out loud). If I tap ""ignore"", the alert goes away and pops back up 10 seconds later. Over and over and over again. It's been this way for 3 days now. I've tried to unpair, reset phone, forget connection and retry it, etc.

What's also strange is when I receive the alert, it doesn't show the name of the contact, just the phone number, which is also strange behavior as the name of the contact is showing on the phone as well as on the car's phone book. Absolutely bizarre behavior.

Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance.

So it was working previously? What carrier?
I don't know anything about the Honda system.  However there is a known bug with one of the GM systems and it could be related.  It simply fails to reliably connect.  I haven't dug too far into the weeds on the issue since my P7Pro doesn't have the problem.  But, from keeping my ear to the ground, a fix for the GM issues are in the current beta and did resolve the issue.  That fix is due next month in the production release.
It worked fine on my samsung, hasn't worked properly since I got my Pixel. I'm was/am with telus for both.
Thanks!
That's got to be the worst rated app I've ever seen on the Play Store. Do you have Android Auto? Have you tried that?
I'll try using Android Auto but it wasn't required before. The car picks up the phone just fine, but for whatever reason it is buggy as hell when it comes to text notifications. I am not using any app from the store; the car has a built in bluetooth phone connection that worked no issue on my last phone. Since I've gotten the Pixel it has issues.
My logic is just trying to rule out what isn't causing the issue. If everything works ok with AA, I'd put blame on the Honda link app.",2025-01-29 16:09:15,4,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1icxb8u/google_pixel_9_pro_issues_with_car_bluetooth/
GooglePixel,Anyone have Pixel 9 Pro XL + Pixel Stand 2 + Magbak Elite?,"I'm looking for a new case and the Magbak Elite seems pretty awesome. My only concern is compatibility with Pixel Stand 2. I haven't found anyone posting about it yet, but from what I heard the stand is finicky with certain cases. Does anyone have this exact setup? 

Comments:
Magbak user here, but no Pixel Stand 2. The case just arrived today for my Pixel 9 Pro XL, so my time with it is extremely limited. I can, however, confirm that my Pixel 6 Pro with that generation's Magbak case worked with the original Pixel Stand.

I don't want to hijack but I do have gripes about the case specifically (I found your thread while researching these gripes). If you'd like, I can try to test with the OG stand, and am happy to answer any questions about the case.
Thanks! Unfortunately I've read that the compatibility faults often stem from the Pixel Stand 2, but that the OG generally worked fine (progress!).

GooglePixel,Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Telephoto Lens Focusing Issue,"Does anybody experience the telephoto lens on the pixel 9 lineup having issues focusing on far subjects?, it's like the lens was not calibrated correctly and it is unable to focus far. On closer objects it is tack sharp, but on further objects it is like it's almost there, but the lens element just does not move enough.

I noticed the autofocus system struggling to compensate for this flaw as when I shoot manual focus, at no point during the slider, does the camera actually focuses on distant objects, but when I set the focus to Auto, the camera focuses beyond what I can achieve in manual mode but still not clear. 

Below is a link to a YouTube video demonstrating the issue: 

https://youtu.be/U0rYxFu46cs

https://youtu.be/ZYUGk_1kLs8

Comments:
I do not have this issue. Focus on distant object is fast on 5x lens for me, both manual and auto. Try cleaning the lens with soft dry cloth (sometimes grease film might be invisible to an eye) and also check that there is no moisture inside.
Just to confirm, have you tried clearing the cache for the Camera app and see if that helps?

Go to Settings > Apps > See all apps > Camera > Storage & Cache > Clear cache.

Additionally, refer to this [article](https://support.google.com/pixelcamera/answer/6306624?hl=en) to learn how to fix camera related issues on your Pixel device.
yes! I have this exact issue on my P9P, especially in 50mp mode. I've tried af, focus peaking etc, but like your video I can't push the focus past some arbitrary point, it seems to hit like 80% of the focus peaking slider moving the focus further away then stop moving. mine has been like this since I got it new from Google uk. it's more evident when you try to move the fours past something in the middle distance like branches it framing a shot then the subject on the background isn't the focus point, it's the branches. Really annoying. I've shot with an slr for 20 years and owned many Pixels but never experienced this.
No moisture, wiped before the creation of the demonstration video
Same on my Pixel 9 Pro. I just tested it and it focused fast for me too.
Confirmed, clearing cache does not resolve the issue

Thank you
glad to know I'm not the only one, at the same time. Quite disappointing to see from a product that is known for its photographic prowess.
Thank you for the update. I’d recommend contacting the Pixel support team via phone or chat [here](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/gethelp?sjid=5534928525397934951-AP). They can take a look at it.
https://i.ibb.co/S7dj0219/Screenshot-20250131-215724.png this is an extreme example but I remember trying everything I could to get the focus on the church in the distance but nothing, af, mf, focus peaking, nothing could get the focus past some arbitrary middle distance point. I've loads of test images with this issue as I noticed it trying out the 5x lens and found it odd.

GooglePixel,New pixel from Samsung,"Afternoon all, I'm not overly tech savvy and needing some help in simpleton terms 

I've had Samsung's for years and decided to branch out to a Pixel 9 last week as the camera looks incredible for my Europe trip later this year. 

Everything about it is fine and mostly the same but the photos?! I had over 20! albums carefully curated over the years;
Holidays, pets ,daily life pictures, meme, selfies, spicy, screenshots of home Reno's, work projects, gym routines, meal preps etc. Just thousands of organized life that is now sorted by date only and an absolute shit show. I have no idea when I saved the 'high protein baked oats' recipe but I'm expected to know it was May 12th, 2019 and scroooooooooolllll back? 

I'm so lost and frustrated this thing cost me like $1600 and it made things impossible for daily life.
I'm walking around with my old Samsung 21 Ultra still for the albums. Can anyone give me a simpleton, child like explanation to help me curate albums again or a YouTube video that doesn't take an 10 min intro of talking sh*t that my ADHD has me zoned out of immediately because they talk too fkn slow 


Thanks so much 💕

Comments:
Unfortunately, there isn't really any way to sync Samsung Gallery albums to the Google Photos app. You'll have to create the albums on Google Photos and add to them manually from your Samsung. 

Or, you can use search, which is pretty good. If you type in ""recipe,"" for example, your recipe should probably pop up.
Install Aves gallery and start tagging your photos. This method is way more powerful than using directory structures. You can even do it on your computer using Digikam.
I transferred from an s21U. It saved my albums. I have to go to collections on the google photo app. Then click on this phone. Then my typical albums pop up.
Every time I transfer from pixel to pixel, all my unsorted photos (camera pictures, screenshots, downloads) are out of any sort of order. Not by date or name. All my albums still exist and are in order, but everything else is a complete mess.",2025-01-29 04:46:34,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1icm13j/new_pixel_from_samsung/

What's your favorite use of the Photosphere captures?
Use this: https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-BigKaka/f/dl80/

Works on my 8a
Honestly this is something that puts me off the newer pixels. Why remove this feature! The ability to create such an immersive 360 degree panorama with a phone is such a unique feature that I didn't expect to love as much as I do on my google pixel 4a 5g and which has ended up a bit of a deal breaker for my switching phones. I especially enjoy looking at them on the google cardboard. Being able to actually take pictures of a scene and then actually view it through that viewer as if it's surrounding you and look around it is more immersive than any other type of picture you can take.
I have it on my P7
Yeah photo sphere was cool. I liked it. I wish they would bring back the dynamic floating preview when you are swipe typing
I missed this feature when I switched from Pixel 2 to Pixel 8.
That's the reason i don't want to upgrade my pixel 7 pro, i use that feature so much:(
Running Android 16 on my Pixel 7, I have Photoshere
I heard Sundar reads this sub so you're golden!
I've got it on my 7Pro. Do you not have it???
The closet thing to Photosphere would be the panorama where you can view a 360 in Google Photos.
And here I thought I might finally break down and give up my P5 this year when the P10 comes out. I didn't even know this was an issue. One more reason to keep on hanging on.
They always looked cool.
I'm not opposed to it being re-implemented because I think more features are always better, but personally I only ever used it as an alternative to Google's abysmal panorama mode.  But now that panorama is properly done (at least on my 9 pro xl anyway) it doesn't bother me that photosphere is gone.
TIL they removed Photosphere on newer pixels.
I don't really understand what people liked about it. I tried using it once but found it really clunky and didn't really like the end result.
Hiking, climbing, bike touring pics, hands down.  Some cool spot, top of a pass, etc., made the coolest ""if you were here too"" pics, IME.

It was tricky to get right though, usually took a couple of tries, per, IME.  I think this is more likely why it was removed.
I have taken at least two to three  (if not more) 360 photos during each trip I have taken. Cool architecture, mountains, lakes, oceans, etc. 
Kinda speaks for itself, yeah?
Nice.... Just installed this and it seems to work fine on Pixel 9 Pro.... Thanks
Does this replace the existing camera apk or modify it? If the latter, if you have two ""stock"" camera apps how do you choose which ones to patch?

I run a Pixel 8 with the stock apk disabled and the Pro apk assigned to the camera shortcut.
Doesn't work on 9 pro XL
Google stopped including the feature starting Pixel 8 series
Not on Pixel 8 and 9 series they don’t
7 Pro is the last Pixel phone with Photosphere
That's gone with the pixel 9 too. They low key got rid of it and introduced the new panorama on the pixel 9 which is actually very similar to the old old photosphere horizontal panorama except it doesn't do 360.
I actually agree, I loved the idea but it wasn't easy enough. It was best for outdoor imagery, but nothing stays that still so *something* will end up being blurred or cut out weirdly. There could be fuzzing around the edges or lines still shown where it didn't stitch properly, but in Google fashion they just let it die instead of trying to improve it. If you're alone in a room, it's fine, everywhere else it basically fails. 

I thought it would come back Ai-i-fied to smooth it out and push another AI experience but apparently not.
I was genuinely interested in knowing what popular uses of those are... viewing on VR headset, posting on Maps...?
Most of the mods should work on the pixels. AGC is also great.
You get 2 camera apps and select the one you want as default.
Oh, why?
Huh, well it might be like the Bluetooth stylus on the S series Ultras, only 1% of people used it lol
I hate the new panorama.
You can view them on your phone as a moveable image. It's nice to capture a full scene, and they're particularly great to relive with even just the cardboard VR viewers.
I think the only possible reason is that they know people at one point are gonna demand for higher quality photo sphere pictures at one point. That feature has basically stayed the same since the existence of the GCam, that point in time is getting closer and Google wants to keep development short. After all, what are you gonna do, buy an iPhone? Oh wait, it doesn't have that feature.
Maybe, but I use it all the time on my Pixel. It's such a cool feature that allows you to relive memories

For anyone wondering, I use [This Method](https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/s/sFBcPRovo3) to use Photosphere on my Pixel 8 Pro, works great 👍
Yeah it made a minor positive splash cause it's higher resolution than any of the older panoramas, but really it was just a minor update to the UI of the photosphere horizontal panorama of the P7 and earlier except they removed the 360 view. I almost always preferred to take incomplete photospheres instead of panoramas though.
Also on the web as a moveable image. I frequently take these and add them publicly to Maps so people can ""immerse"" themselves by virtually visiting locations with cool vistas
And photo sphere takes higher quality panoramic shots than panoramic mode.
I don't know what I might be doing wrong, but it just doesn't work for me. I end up with awkwardly 'stitched' photos half the time with obvious inconsistencies, whereas the last UI was always very smooth.
Doing God's work.

👽🙏🏿
It works best for outdoor/landscape use since everything is far away, and parallax errors are more forgiving. You need to pivot on the lens. Make sure to keep the main lens at the same point in space at all times. What has helped me for indoor use is if I have some kind of guide like a stick that I can prop on the floor and use its tip as a marker to pivot the lens on. It's very difficult to just do it by eye, the lens always moves significantly especially the wider you go.
I appreciate the advice! Is that what happened here? https://imgur.com/a/gRnsMWl
tbh the stitching there is not that bad and you can see only the closer objects like the low wall left of center at the bottom, and some blurring on the nearby buildings. The issue seems to be some weird processing that made those darkened vertical strips. Might be a glitch, or do you get that with all panoramas? I can't say I've seen that yet.
Maybe 30% of the time it happens and I can't figure out why. It's especially an issue with clouds like this.",2025-01-29 02:45:37,238,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1icjsrh/google_bring_back_photosphere_on_camera/

There's face tracking

Yes

Yes

Rear yes, not front

>is the autofocus fully working in highres mode 

I don't think there's any difference in autofocus when in different res modes at least from my experience

>does the camera app remember settings and modes and can resume where I left it 

No, but I agree it should. It's annoying.

>is there some kind of motion detects to prevent motionblur or maybe even a shutterspeed limit in ProMode

In 50mp it can be tricky to deal with moving objects.  You can however manually set the shutter speed.
It's only HDR+ raw, which has some amount of the pixel processing pipeline.  Pixel raw files are also variably compatible with apps.

Autofocus is either auto, object tracking, or locked.

There are manual controls for the still camera for focus, iso, shutter speed, and color/white balance.  There are no pro/manual controls for video

You can shoot and save 50mp mode.  It works on all the rear cameras. 

Autofocus works the same in 50mp mode as 12mp mode.

The app will persist still camera settings for resolution, lens selection (auto vs manual), flash, focus type (auto macro or no auto macro) and image ratio.  It will persist some video settings.  It does not have a feature to launch back into the camera in the mode you were in last time; it always launches the camera app to the still camera ""normal"" photo mode. 

There are no settings for motion detection or shutter speed limit regarding motion blur, but I'll point our that where all of my galaxy S ultra phones would fall flat on their face with motion blur when there should be none, pixels in auto mouse just freeze subjects much better; that's the single best advantage to a pixel over a samsung phone in my option when it comes to still camera. 

Honestly, pixels are auto shooters first, and manual shooters at a distant second.  This is even more evidence by the awful UI layout Google chose for the camera app with most things buried in menus instead of on the viewfinder UI.
In addition to the other comments, go to a store and try it out. In my experience autofocus is not the best I come from a S10e. Especially 5x videos It can be good but also lose focus on moving objects.

Having said that I am happy with the 5x 48mp camera. Does really zoom in a way that makes a noticeable difference. This is the first phone I can do some plane spotting with. 

I have tried editing raw in snapseed but have not had more success making it look better than the fully processed picture.",2025-01-28 18:57:55,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ic95kc/pixel_9_pro_what_is_the_camera_app_able_to_do/

I assume you mean ""reboots"" instead of ""resets"". That's not a normal experience at all.

You can try using [Safe Mode](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2852139?hl=en) to identify if any of your installed apps are causing issues, or if there's something wrong with the phone itself. If everything works fine in Safe Mode, then you'll need to go through your installed apps and figure out which one is problematic.

If you're still seeing issues in Safe Mode, you could try getting a replacement from Google. They'll likely ask you to factory reset the phone first and see if there are still issues.
That is definitely not a common issue at all!  You should contact support for assistance troubleshooting this behavior.

GooglePixel,Considering the switch from iPhone 16 Pro Max to Pixel 9 Pro XL,"Hi folks,

I was on Android before (a Xiaomi device) but I’ve returned to iPhone because I thought, and I still think, that third-party apps are more polished and optimized, but there are many things I find better on Android. In addition, I don’t like iOS 18 at all. 

That being said, I’m still on the fence about the change, in particular I’d like to know how 9 Pro XL behaves regarding:

1) **battery life**: I bought the 16 Pro Max because I’ve read that battery life was incredible, but I don’t find that to be the case

2) **photos** I’m an amateur photographer and I like especially to take pictures of landscapes. I’m wondering in particular how 9 Pro XL scores regarding night/low light photos

3) does using the phone during the night cause eyestrain?

Thanks a lot!

Comments:
I made the same transition less than a month ago.
I had an iPhone 16 Pro Max until January 7th, when I got a P9P XL.
I have always considered myself a Pixel kind of guy, so for me it's kind of a return to ""home"", but at the same time I have a huge respect for Apple and enjoyed their phones.

Here are my personal thoughts about what you asked (all my answers are based on my experience and are purely subjective. don't take them as ""gospel"".)

1. Battery: I agree with you, the 16 Pro Max's battery is not formidable especially after Apple activated ""Apple Intelligence"". (The drop in battery life was very visible, at least in my case.)
Battery wise, don't expect much better from the P9P XL, though. It's kind of similar. For my use case I get about 26/28 hours per charge like I had with the iPhone.

2. Night and low light photography: the P9P XL is much better than the iPhone 16 Pro Max in that regard. I have a three-year-old I love to take photos of. He never stays still. With the iPhone the photos at night or in low light were often soft and slightly out of focus. Quite disappointing.
The P9P XL is much more reliable in that department. Photography-wise I find it more engaging, a pleasure to use.
Its video capabilities have improved too, but I find them still a tad inferior compared to the iPhone's.

3. Eyestrain: no issues. There are several settings you can activate to make it easier to use at night.

I hope this helps.
> does using the phone during the night cause eyestrain?


The phone has ""dim mode"" but to be honest I don't even use that, the default lowest brightness is fine for me and causes no strain. However it's not as good as the iPhone.
Don’t do it, waste of money. The pixel 9 pro xl has worse battery life, worse camera, tensor chip highly under performs compared to other flagships, and forget gaming if you play games here and there. Also basically no third parties create products for the pixel.  

Everyday quality of life stuff on iOS doesn’t translate over such as passwords stored for apps/login and Face ID security. 

Only things good about the pixel is the solid point and shoot camera and Google exclusive features like screen calling. 

I have both phones but I rarely use the pixel 9 pro xl anymore. It’s just weak performance compared to other flagships out. I really hope Google steps up with tensor 5 next year.
Yeah, it's tough.
I honestly wouldn't go for 256 GB if I were you.
I got mine in ""porcelain"" (512 GB). I usually try to get all my phones white and this was close enough. It's gorgeous.
As someone who flirted with a 16 promax and returned it, I second your battery life complaints. It is good, but idk how reviews are getting 12+hours of battery life as I could barely make it to 10. Also not a fan of iOS on such a big device...it just looks and feels like it still designed for smaller phones (example is all the dead space at the top around the clock and no resizable keyboard, feels to low)


Few nice things about coming back to pixel:
While I will admit the battery is also just ""good"", I do use my phone at full resolution instead of the standard which can save some battery life and GPU usage and is setup like that out of the box.
I personally like the crispiness of the higher resolution but is not necessary to leave on.
Also I feel like in terms of stock apps, Google is the closest thing to refinement to apple. Yes many apps don't work or look as nice than on iOS, but at least the stock ones are solid.


Only serious gripe is that there is still an ugly ass bar at the top of most apps that don't force to go over the camera cutout area. I had this issue with my 6a and worse on the 9 pro XL as the cut off area has been increased. Almost every other manufacturers force this on a UI level but Google. At least apple colors the area to match the app. I know it's a visual thing but just looks bad to my eyes and also pushes full screen videos closer to the bottom of the screen and makes like looks lop sided. 
I would stay with Iphone, just wait till the seventeen comes out and watch
I'd stay with the iPhone for now. If you do want to give the Pixel a try at least keep the iPhone. 
I did the opposite and went to an iPhone 16 Pro from a Pixel 8. I'm now back on the Pixel and sold the iPhone. I couldn't get on with iOS.
My Pixel 9 Pro lasts all day plus some. Editing Photos is the coolest thing ever. And there's night mode and blue light modes you can turn on.
Stick with what you already have, you may not like iOS 18 but you'll be coming back to complain about the lack of blue bubbles and FaceTime before you know it. 

In all seriousness though, they're both great devices but why spend the money when you already have one of the most premium devices out there?
1.Switched from 15 Pro Max ( before Apple Intelligence ) ios 18, Battery is worse on Pixel
2.Photos looks better ( cause Pixel ), night time performance isn't perfect ( try and decide )
3. Dont know. I really cant tell
My girlfriend is not very happy with her iphone 16. Bad battery life and weird bugs like random restarting. Her 14 was much better. Think there might be something going on in apple land
I went from a 16 Pro to a Pixel 9. Battery is significantly better on the Pixel compared to my iPhone. I'm 14 hours off charger and sitting at 70% in my Pixel. My iPhone would have been at 40% by now. Heck, I started charging the iPhone in the middle of the day.

Photos are great on both devices. I wouldn't say one is better than the other. I slightly prefer the Pixel interface and night sight.

No eye strain.
I'm using a 16 Pro (smaller version) and have a P9PXL rn, so i can kinda help


1. I get similar battery on my 16 pro on my Pixel 9 Pro XL. Usually 5-6 hours SOT consistently over 24 hours since last unplugged. Lasts longer if you don't use as much screentime and even longer if you're just at home using WiFi


2. I think the Pixel camera is better in terms of stills and okay with videos with the iPhone is definitely far better in terms of videos.


3. I don't think it causes eyestrain. I like the bedtime mode feature where you set a time you're likely to fall to bed and the screen turns black and white, it's pretty convenient. i do find the screen to be a little bit more brighter at the lowest brightness and the extra dim feature really doesn't lower the better that much more.

If there's one thing I don't like is that if you
I haven't had serious battery life issues on any pixel for several generations now. At least in my past (I have owned every pixel and nexus before that) the worst pixel in terms of battery life was the Pixel 4 which was pretty bad and even then it wasn't as bad as my Nexus 4 from the old days. My Pixel 6 Pro was mid, Pixel 7 Pro was better, and Pixel 8 Pro easily lasted longer than I ever needed a phone to last. I am using the smaller 9 Pro now (8 pro only came in an XL size) and it easily lasts me a whole day with charging limited to 80%. I end the day with about 35-40%. If I charge to 100% I am easily getting two days. I am not a heavy user but do use Android Auto (which is usually a battery killer) and I mostly use it for music, texting, emails, web browsing, scrolling twitter, etc. 

The reason I love the pixel is the point and shoot camera's. No matter which pixel I had its always been point, click, shoot, done. I never have to think twice about the picture. Low light is exceptional, and the extra camera features have always impressed me. I love the astro mode, capturing gifs of shooting stars blows people away. Its just easy.

Eye strain isn't an issue because I have scheduled a ""night mode"" to turn on at around 7:30pm and turn off around 9am, and you can customize how strong you want the night mode to be and when it goes on and off. I don't find any issues with eye strain and I get eye strain migraines from work as I stair at screens all day anyways.

I have helped many friends switch from iPhone to Pixel over the years and so far no complaints from anyone. I think its going to blow your mind how intuitive the device is.
Battery life is about the same as the Pro Max in real world scenarios, maybe slightly better in my experience. It really depends on how you use your device.

If you have any sensitivity to OLED flickering, don't get the Pixel. It doesn't bother me at all but others have complained about it.
Also been considering moving over to P9P XL. But the color that I want ( hazel ) on att only has 256gb . I currently have 512gb on my 16 pro max and am using 299gb already. I know that Google storage exists but don’t know if that is much of a hassle to operate. What would you do?
I made similar move. I think you are correct. Battery gets better with time. Highly dependent on screen brightness you use. On high this thing is a spotlight.  I use the nightlight from sundown to sunup and it is very easy on my eyes
Hi man, thanks for your feedback, very interesting since you've made the same switch.  
I have a couple other questions, if you don't mind:

1. Did you experience any issue, such app freezing or lags while scrolling the screen or switching apps? What about the general performances in daily use, in comparison to 16 Pro Max?
2. Has the network reception always been good and reliable under 5G and Wi-Fi? No signal drops?
3. Can I use Gemini while the phone is locked?
4. What about the sound quality and overall loudness of the speakers?
5. Is Google Photos good for browsing the photo gallery? I've heard mixed opinions about that
6. Is it possible to enable an ad-blocker in Chrome? On the iPhone I was able to enable an ad-block extension (for Safari though)
7. Any heating issues? If I've understood well, that was a problem of previous Pixels

Thanks a lot!
Thanks man. Do you have any feedback also about the other points?

thanks man, yeah TBH I'm quite surprised that I'm missing many Android features. The only gripe is that iPhone third-party apps are in general more polished and optimized.   
  
Do you have a Pixel 9 Pro XL? How do you find it in comparison to iPhone 16 Pro, regarding: battery life, general day-to-day performances, network quality and signal realibility, and camera performance in standard and low-light situations?  
Thanks
Why did you switch? In general are you regretting it?
Yeah I’m very surprised TBH do you have any feedback about the points above? Thanks man

I've had no issues with flickering on my pixel 9 pro
thanks man. A couple questions:  
  
1) Would you say that battery life is on par or even better that iPhone 16 Pro Max?

2) What do you think about the performances of the camera in standard and low-light situations, in comparison to Pro Max?

3) Did you experience any issue, such app freezing or lags while scrolling the screen or switching apps? What about the general performances in daily use, in comparison to 16 Pro Max?

Thanks
Sure, no problem.

1. There are no issues of any kind (no app freezing or lags while scrolling) except for audio latency over Bluetooth, like while watching a video on YouTube or a movie on Netflix while wearing earbuds (Pixel Buds Pro 2, in my case). The latency, while not huge, is annoying. I believe it is due to the lack of particular codecs on the Pixels. I don't remember having the same issue with iPhones or Samsung Galaxies. So far, I have not been able to resolve it.

2. Reception is reliable and strong with WiFi and 5G (I'm in the US and use T-Mobile.)

3. Yes, you can. You must enable it in the settings, as it is off by default.

4. The sound quality and loudness are good. It's perfect for podcasts and music. Still, I would list it a tad lower compared to the iPhone, especially for loudness (the iPhone is louder). If the iPhone is a 5-star device audio-wise, the Pixel gets 4.5 stars (IMO).

5. It's subjective, but in my case, especially since I have been using Google Photos for ages (and I used it even with the iPhone, alongside the native app), I think it works just fine, if not better, especially for searching capabilities.

6. Ha! That's a good question. I tried doing it myself, too, but failed. Apparently, Google does not allow you to activate ad blockers in Pixel Chrome. The best option is to use another browser like Brave or Firefox if you want to activate an ad blocker.

7. No heating issues.

  
And here are a couple of extra thoughts free of charge ;) 

8. I'm not sure if you are a gamer, but the P9P XL, while entirely usable, is not a gamer phone. If pushed to the limits, say, with higher video settings, max refresh rate, and long sessions, it might experience issues like overheating (a bit, nothing too worrying) or starting to skip frames. 

9. If you want the closest experience to IOS in the Android world, look at the new OnePlus 13. The UX is very, very close to what you experience with an iPhone while still allowing a vast degree of customization typical of an Android phone. The phone is good and fast. Battery-wise and charging speed are superb. I still prefer the Pixel, but the OP13 is a valid option worth considering.

10. Lastly, the most critical piece of advice, in my opinion: if you can and assume that you have access to a decent return policy, I recommend getting the Pixel (if you decide to pull the trigger) and testing it yourself in parallel to the iPhone you already have. I don't remember if you are in the US or not, but here, most sellers usually allow a 15-day return period for any device (some have a re-stocking fee of $50 or so). The best thing is to use that time to test the hell out of the new phone so you will know whether it fits your needs. In other words, take your time, if you can, before selling or sending back the iPhone.  

If you decide to try it, remember that the Pixel will take about 4-5 days to learn your use pattern, which it needs to understand the optimal battery use/recharge speed. So, if the battery life seems horrible the first few days, it's normal, and don't worry about it. After a week or so, you can see the actual battery life.

I hope it helps. Let me know if you have other questions. And good luck!
I would say that dim mode, even with extra dim, is at the edge of being too bright. Definitely it could go dimmer. Battery life should be decent. Low light photos definitely to be taken with the night sight mode. 
1. No UI is perfect. I still feel that iOS is the smoothest. But it also has a ""sluggishness"" with all the different animations and what not. In terms of the pixel, it's probably the closest your gonna get to iPhone smoothness. In daily use apps it feels about the same, just with a snappier feel on the pixel imo. I do notice some stutters in heavier games, but the pixels aren't really tuned well for gaming. No issue switching apps, most stay open for a long while(outside of YouTube but it refreshed quite a bit on iPhone as well)


2. I didn't get much time with the cameras on the iPhone, but the pictures on both are great but I do prefer the way pixels take pictures more. Low light is really good. Astro photography is really cool on the pixel (super long exposure) I take a lot of landscape shots and prefer how they come out on the pixel. Color accuracy on all three lens are better on iPhone but just slightly.


3. Wi-Fi and mobile data both are great. No issues that I've experienced.


4.so for a LONG TIME, there have been rumors that a full fledged chrome browser is coming. Or possibly a chrome os desktop mode. That said, you can't use desktop extensions with chrome on Android. However, there are a quite a few browsers that do. Brave has a great ad blocker built in(works on YouTube as well). Fire fox has a short list of extensions but are working to have most of not all more on mobile soon. So you have options until Google possiblity allows extensions on Chrome for Android.


5. I've used a 6a a few years ago for a while. Fantastic phone for the price I paid. That said, living in Florida it heated up VERY quick. (I.e. take one or two pictures and it turned into a hot pocket). My 9 pro xl is literally night and day. It does get pretty warm wirelessly charge which the iPhone did as well. And of course with 3d games it does as well. But  not uncomfortably so and especially not while doing day to day tasks. One thing I notes with the 16 promax is I noticed while browsing the web for a while or streaming video it got surprisingly hot (something the 15 series had an issue with as well) I understand an update recently fixed it, but whatever Google did with the thermals and tuning, it's fantastic.


Hope this helps!
15promax overheated on basic uses. Ios 18 sucks. Wanted to try something new. Not regrectting at all.
Well I don't care too much about picture quality. My pixel 7 is fine for me. No problems in low light. Battery has never been a great strength of the newer pixels but the 9 is supposed to be better
1. Generally, the iPhone is smoother and performance is better. Scrolling through Reddit or Twitter on the iPhone is a bit smoother. Pixel isn’t bad - the Pixel 9 series is better than prior generations. I will caveat that my iPhone had issues where maybe 10% of the time the scrolling would be janky. This occurred across all apps (e.g. the Settings app). Not sure if it’s a bug or intended, but it seems like apple is throttling the 120hz down to 60 or 80hz for some reason. Either way, it was frustrating enough to be a factor for me to switch. IPhone also did better at holding apps in memory (I just have the normal P9, so guessing the P9 pros are better). Overall, slight advantage to iPhone but with the one caveat.

2. Network reception has been comparable. No issues.

3. Yes. Some functionality might be locked, but for Home commands and adding reminders, etc., no issues.

4. I rarely use the speakers, so can’t comment too much. Base devices seemed fine.

5. I prefer Google Photos over iOS’s Photos app. I like how Google Photos will combine very similar photos into a single card, which makes things look a little cleaner. I think the memories and AI is also much better. 

6. Nope, no heating issues. Overall I’ve been pleasantly surprised with the performance and heating. Scrolling isn’t quite as good as the iPhone, but it’s just for a couple apps.
1. Nope. Can there be a buggy app? Sure, but most native apps and the top 10,000 apps on the app store will probably work 100% of the time. Personally don't have any issues with apps or lag when scrolling.

2. The network reception on my 8 Pro and 9 Pro is exceptional, and even when people complained about the 6 pro and 7 pro, they had better reception than my familys other devices (oneplus 11, oneplus 12, iphone 13, and etc). So maybe for pixel the 6 and 7 series were bad, but they were still better in my experience than other devices. I live in an area with bad reception and my pixel is the one that works in the house.

3. Yes you can use gemini with the screen off and locked for most things, some things you do need to unlock for, usually requiring connections to other apps, but as far as answering a question or setting an alarm or a task works just fine.

4. The speakers on the 8 pro and 9 pro were so loud that people thought I was watching on my TV in my house. Kid you not, that is what someone asked me once ""turn the TV down"" (it was my phone).

5. Google photos has a library tab where you can browse photos and folders like a PC/file manager. There is also a built in file manager in the phone to manage files and photos like a literal PC if you want.

6. No there are no extensions allowed on chrome or many other browsers. If you want to use something like uBlock Origin (the best blocker in the world) Firefox is the way to go on mobile as it supports all the plug ins the desktop version supports (I also use firefox for easier tab sharing and syncing between my devices which is really nice). You can also use Arc Search (the mobile version of the Arc Browser, which has ublock built in and in my opinion, is the superior mobile browsing experience).

7. No heating issues since around Pixel 6 days.

You are very welcome.
They perform about the same for the most part.  Pixel has a better camera especially in low light and with motion.  Apple is better for video. I dont game so not sure about that.
Def not too bright on dim mode ... at least not on my Pixel 9 Pro Fold. You can go into your settings for dim mode and set it even lower, I'm not sure if you knew that.
Awesome man. Does Pixel 9 Pro XL battery last a entire day?
awesome thanks man. I'm experiencing a couple of bugs on iOS too (frankly I'm quite surprised iOS 18 is that bad), in addition to underwhelming battery life. And the keyboard, damn I miss Android's keyboard lol  
I'm seriously considering making the switch
Thanks man, very interesting insight. I’m really considering the switch at this point
Thats what I meant. With that it's equal to my Xperia 1 VI lowest brightness (without extra dim).
Really depends on your usage. Personally a no for me. But the battery life is kinda same same with other android flagships ( DO YOUR RESEARCH )
I think you will love it. Feel free to shoot any questions along the way.
Thanks so much mate. Which cover are you using, if any?
I am using the Google Pixel case. They used to make these really nice woven fabric ones (shame they stopped and switched to an iphone style silicone with fabric lining inside). But I got it with my google store credit when I preordered. Haze phone color hazel case color combo is nice.

My personal favorite outside of that is the spigen liquid air, it has plenty of grip and is very drop proof in my experience.

The best time to buy a pixel in general is either on preorder or when the 150-200$ off discounts happen, because during the preorder window you get the highest trade in values AND like 200$ in credits for things like a case, watch, etc.

Another thing I just thought about, make sure you have a fast charging brick and usb-c cable. You want something compatible with USB PD 3.1.",2025-01-28 17:45:35,10,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ic7dgp/considering_the_switch_from_iphone_16_pro_max_to/
GooglePixel,"Gemini launched for iPhone, does having a Pixel 9 give me an advantage?","The Pixel and iPhone app is exactly the same. I was hoping for an inbuilt premium version of Gemini for atleast Pixel users. 

Comments:
All up to personal preference. You can have Gemini as a digital assistant on Pixel but gotta stick with Siri on iPhone (for now..). All google apps are available on iPhone and work better than the android versions shockingly. Ecosystems are all down to personal preference at this point.
Spoiler: Google treats iOS the same if not better than Android. iOS users overwhelmingly use Google services. You will find Apple users never complain about a missing app or lack of support because it’s given that they get it.

All these talk of rivalry is just made up frankly. Google wants business regardless from where.
You actually get better lockscreen customization and more handy tools built-in on iphone (Compass, level, AR distance measurement, conversions in the calculator, shortcuts/routines app, remappable button).
Discounts and faster rollouts. Better integration. Pro models give a free premium subscription.
you don't get utilities and other integration in Gemini for iOS. So you won't be able to use Gemini on iOS to create iOS tasks or events in the iOS calendar.
No, it's just as pointless for iPhone users.
Gemini is an app available on any Android and now iOS device. 
Gemini Live is a Pixel 9, P9P & P9PXL exclusive feature. Happy to be corrected.

Edit: updated to include app available on Android & iOS
Yes.  It's not ios
Why the downvotes? My ques is simple and would bring clarity for others. Dont us all pixel users want to feel privileged??!!
I'd imagine any new functions will come to Pixel first but I think at this point anyone who truly believes that the tensorship is providing all that much benefit when it comes to the AI powered tasks is full of themselves.
The real strength of pixel is android. I just installed a chromium based browser with full extensions support. Good luck doing this on iOS. It's been 17 years and iOS browser is still a toy. One of the most important apps on a phone is in the stone age. 
> The Pixel and iPhone app is exactly the same.

That's the wrong way to look at this. Gemini on a Pixel is directly integrated into the Pixel's software. Gemini on iOS is just a standalone app, which can also be accessed on Android. If you're just going to use it through the app then you've already missed the boat on how much they differ in implementation.

It's like saying the Apple Music app on Android is the same as the one on iOS.

> I was hoping for an inbuilt premium version of Gemini for atleast Pixel users. 

I mean, you do.

Most Gemini Extensions don't work on iPhones outside of the Google-only ones; you don't get Circle to Search and the other contextual search options natively (aside from Lens integration); and it doesn't integrate with the iOS system apps as it does on the Pixel, so smart home controls and the like are unsupported.

It doesn't (yet) have shortcut support, you can only add it as a home screen widget if you also have the Google app installed; and setting it to open via the action button is kludgy, again thanks to the lack of native app intent support. Finally, it doesn't have an iPad app.

EDIT: stupidly forgot that a few of the Gemini-powered features run locally on the Pixel 9 too, like summarisation and writing tools, as well as Pixel Studio, Pixel Screenshots, the AI weather insights, and Call Notes, among other things.
Other than not having to use a trash iPhone? Not sure. I'm a bit annoyed they branched this out to all devices as well, but it seems like that's their focus instead of the actual phones. I hope that's not a sign of things to come from Pixel 10 and onward, because the Pixel 9 launch was focused on Gemini and not even the phones.
Gboard not so much
>(for now..)

Apple isn't going to allow any alternatives to Siri, no matter how badly it performs.
""All google apps are available on iPhone and work better than the android versions shockingly.""

In my experience, this is utterly false.
This may change soon. Google is no longer providing their employees an IPhone, Pixel only.
Oh darn, I have pixel 9, so no premium. Dont see any discounts yet??!!
Google assistant did the same and its no use to me. I would value a premium version more than integrations. Integrations dont last too long and user experience is blehh
Loll
Its now available across https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15274899?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid#:~:text=With%20Gemini%20Live%2C%20you%20can%3A,to%20make%20a%20business%20plan.
I like it exactly because differently from Apple they don't tight you to their devices, this gives me freedom to switch if I want to and use their softwares without having to commit to a specific platform.
I use both daily. Wouldn't exactly call the iPhone trash lol
Exactly!! All those advertisements showing people using gemini on pixel 9 indicated exclusivity and premium bundling. 

But the same functionality can be done on any phone now, so why such misleading advertising??
Doesn’t change the fact that iPhone still gets well supported by Google.
Thought there was one for Gemini but can't seem to find it https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/13529884?hl=en
What you need
An iPhone or iPad.
The Gemini mobile app.
For now, Gemini Live isn’t available in the Gemini web app, or the Gemini tab in the Google app on iPhone.
I guess that's another way to look at it.
Point is not Gemini, its Pixel with an illusion of premium Gemini services. Remember Android One phone? Or previous pixels that came with much enhanced google drive spaces without anu extra charges
Where is this delusion coming from? Apple doesn’t tie you to their devices, you CAN freely switch. You don’t even need to login to iCloud to even use a iPhone. You can freely use any Google services, and completely avoid the native apps.

It’s the same case for Android. Once you are past the initial setup, you are free to use any email and calendar client.
I would, I despise iOS.
Thank you
where does this illusion comes from? They literally launched some of their features and services on Samsung first and their apps works very well on iOS

What i got with my pixel was one year of gemini advanced for ""free""
The delusion comes from someone who worked for Apple for 5 years and owned (still owns some) Apple Devices for more than 10 years.  
Try to keep your icloud, apple music, potos, maps, fitness, page, numbers and keynote app on your android and then try to use google services (drive, youtube premium, google photos, fitbit, and google maps, Gsuite) on an iphone. Tell me then which service suite gives you more flexibility.

So yeah, I'm happy Gemini is platform agnostic, Apple competitor probably wont.  
p.s. an iPhone is not a software
So are you not mislead by Pixel ads? You still need to pay for gemini premium like all other phone users. What makes you deciding to get Pixel any different?
1yr? Which pixel and how did you activate. I have a pixel 9
Pixel 9 Pro XL bought during the launch promotion in Europe (256 for the price of 128 and 1 year of gemini advanced + 2tb drive) and a decent trade in value.  
It wasn't cheap for the SOC it has...but it wasn't a bad deal either
Sounds like a pretty good bundle. I have the simple 9 so maybe no gemini advanced for me",2025-01-28 15:44:51,0,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ic4g1d/gemini_launched_for_iphone_does_having_a_pixel_9/
GooglePixel,IPhone 13 user wanting to go to Google Pixel; any advice?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been considering switching to Android, and specifically to a Google Pixel.

I’ve been an iOS user my entire life, but honestly, it’s starting to feel a bit mundane for me. I think Android might suit my needs and preferences better.

Initially, I was looking at the Google Pixel 9 Pro, but I started to worry, what if I don’t like it? 

I’d end up spending a lot on a phone I’m not happy with.

So, I’ve been thinking about getting the Google Pixel 7a instead. 

Would it be a good idea to use the Pixel 7a as a way to test out whether the Pixel is right for me, especially coming from an iPhone 13?

Comments:
Any advice? Yes. Search the sub for ""iPhone"" and see the hundreds upon hundreds of helpful discussions already here.
Go for 8a that was the best take feature :-) (and other goodies)
Imo there is no way you won't like the Pixel 9 Pro coming from Iphone. The Pixel is basically the iPhone of androids. I definitely would go for the 9 Pro as its been very refined and is the best they currently have to offer. Go for the 8a at the very least. Google apps sync seamlessly with Pixel phones so if you use Google docs or photos it will be easy. Pixels are easy to use and have tons of useful daily features so you will likely have a great experience with the 9 Pro coming from am iPhone 13 especially. The Pixel 9, 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL also have the same boxy design as the iPhone so it will feel similar in the hand too
No, get the 9 pro. It's got the best of Pixel right now. If you get a previous version, you'll be making a new post about how Pixels are disappointing and sh*t.
I was on the 13 and I switched to the 8a. Learn from my mistake, do not get the ""a"" the fingerprint scanner is frustrating as hell.
Google pixel scroll lag.  Maybe you'll get a phone with it, maybe you won't. I had it and bailed on that phone after 3 months.
Go for pixel 9 its best
If you are deep in the Apple ecosystem, especially notes and reminders, it’ll be hard to find decent replacements that integrate even remotely close to as well as iOS does it. Android is a great operating system but as far as apps go, it’s patchwork. You’re gonna have to try a bunch of different apps to accomplish any level of productivity with minimal system integration or fluidity. Any current android users have work arounds and multiple third-party apps that often have missing features or are bloated. Love my Pixel 9 pro xl but yeah… anyone who has been deep in the Apple ecosystem knows how much better it really is once you start using an android phone. Most android users don’t understand how much better iOS really is for ease of use, functionality, & interoperability between devices. However, you can definitely customize android devices more but iOS is catching up on that front. Keep in mind if you have a Mac or iPad you will definitely lose some functionality between devices.
if you are going to go for it then i would suggest going for the 9 series.  going for the 7a seems a bit strange to me - if you want to get a good feel for the Pixel experience dont go for the two-generation old mid-range model.  

go to a retailer that has Pixel display models and play around with a 9 series model for a while.  see how you like it.  then at least you wouldnt be going into it blind.  no matter what you do theres going to be a certain amount of risk of ""not liking it"" at play but going and testing one in person would lessen that risk as much as possible.
Maybe buy a used 8 series that won't loose much value after a couple months in case you don't like it it just resale it. 
The only thing that bugs me about my pixel 7 is that fingerprint unlock is horrible for me but apparently they got better at 8. 
But I have air pods, and M1 Mac that I love but can't stand iPhones...
Looks like if you were an iPhone user for a long time and bought very many apps you're going to have to start all over again buying apps unless you have some real big compelling reason to leave I would stay.
Don't try to make it like your iPhone.  Accept when things are different than how it is on iOS.  Figure out what is essential uses for your phone and ensure they are available on the Pixel..

Be open to change and things can be done differently and sometimes, this actually leads to better outcomes and aren't actually compromises.

Enjoy.
I would refrain from the A series of Pixels not because they are bad phones but because the Pro and Pro XL models are just so much better. For a first time experience, I think it would be more impactful to go with a Pro model so you can experience what the Pixel line truly has to offer. Plus, depending on your carrier and if you decide to switch, you can get insane deals almost always on the Pro and Pro XL models. You can always scale back to an A series in the future if you decide the Pro model is more than you need or want.

The one thing I will say is to make sure you get a decent screen protector. The 7 series especially is sensitive to micro scratches. Not sure about anything forward from there. I'm waiting on my 9 pro xl to come in the mail.
Buy it direct from Google. If you don’t like it - return it.
Before I answer thoroughly, *why* do you believe Android might suit your needs and preferences better? 

You are on a Pixel sub, an echo chamber that will tell you how to immediately drop the iPhone and get the Pixel. That's the reality, and this is coming from someone who's last two phones, as well as who's current one, is a Pixel. 

What is your budget? Do you regularly take photos? If not, then I would recommend getting the Pixel over the 9 Pro. If you want a cheaper phone, I think you should wait until the 9a comes out in mid-March. The caveat, of course, is that it will have fewer bells and whistles. 

The Pixel might be good for you, but you will have to make an active effort to read articles and look at videos on Android/Pixel functionality and system/keyboard tricks. Don't give up after just a week of using it. There is often a 30 day period in which you can return the phone, so I believe you should spend at *least* 2-3 weeks with or before returning it.
Not sure why you would waste time trying to “find excitement” in a device. I frankly believe you will just be frustrated with the technical support and outstanding issues. 

You get more or less the same Google services on iOS.
Moving from one way of you using your phone to another a brand new way of using it is a lift. I'd argue all day long that android is way more intuitive than iOS. But muscle memory is hard to break. With that being said, if you truly invest yourself into a pixel phone and ecosystem and break away from iOS, meaning not have expectations that your apple watch will still work, airpods will switch automatically between your phone and mac, you should be good and you'll see a lot you like about Android and it'll probably expose what you miss about iOS. For me, android offers way more than iOS in fundamental ways that whenever I'm on iOS I always want to jump back to a pixel. It's fair to say also, that they both accomplish a lot of the same goals, they just go about it differently in most cases. Notifications being a big one...spoiler alert: they aren't good on iOS and android has set the gold standard there.
So just for contrast , I’m going back to iPhone after 26 months with Pixel. 

I switched from 14 pro max to 7 pro. It was a bumpy ride, the quality was always dubious at best. I’ve had the device repaired last year for screen and camera. Screen used to flicker in sunlight, and main camera used to distort image, especially noticeable on photographing text. The camera worked fine for a few weeks after being repaired, then it started distorting again.

The screen on the other hand worked perfectly right until it died without a warning. It started flashing green, no response, resets wouldn’t help, and it all happened two weeks after warranty expired.
I went to buy 8 pro and am disappointed. The screen flickers slightly in dark mode, is sometimes unresponsive, especially when I try to switch songs on lockscreen widget. 

Software is also kinda moody. I found myself loving android and there are lots of features which I will certainly miss, but… when I’m in an app and receive a text message/messenger/whatsapp and try to respond from this little pop up, it doesn’t work. The popup starts to jiggle and I can’t do anything. And it happens on P7P AND P8P…

So, as much as I found Android better suited to my needs actually, I gravitate towards iOS reliability and Apple general quality more. 

And there’s the obvious - iPad, MacBook, AirPods, Apple TV at home ;)
Look up googlfying your iPhone. See if you.like it
Lots of iPhone users have switched to pixel 9 pro and do not regret it.
Like others have mentioned definitely go for the pixel 9 pro. It's an amazing phone.
Do it! I am a rabid pixel fan. I have had P6, seven, eight, and now nine Pro XL. The pixel 9 series ironed out all, and I mean all issues. It is simply a pleasure to use!
Go for it!
I moved from iphone 14 to pixel 9. Only miss the airdrop , everything else was smooth.

At first I got pixel 6a as a secondary phone (for work) and liked basically everything about it except that it wasn't powerful enough, so I waited for pixel 9 and got it. 


If you aren't in a hurry I would say wait for pixel 9a or get 8a to test the water. Pixel 10 will be a bit change because Google moves to a completely new  processor similar like apple did couple years ago, so I would say get a cheaper one, they are on sail pretty often and then if you like it get the 10th next autumn or go back to iPhone (I don't think I'll ever do that btw, pixel is great so far)
I've always had apple products my whole life and still have iPads and Macbooks etc but iPhone's are just too expensive now. My friend told me a Google Pixel is the most iPhone friendly android phone there is so I got one and I love it. If there was an iPhone for the same price I'd go for the Google. I don't regularly use the camera or anything but it's been super durable, battery life is great. It just works and there are lots of little features inside of apps like the alarm apps and stuff that you'll come across that are just that little bit better than on an iPhone.

The only thing is if you have other Apple devices then you will miss AirDrop.
I just switched from the 14 pro max to the Pixel pro 9 xl and I love it. I too was entangled in the apple ecosystem for years and began to feel like the upgrades really didn't feel like sufficient upgrades. I kinda miss apple pay (sending to others) and some apps aren't as seamless  but other than that I'm very happy with the switch
8a is a solid phone.
My son and I have 7a and the phone has been flawless. My partner has an 8 Pro and also zero issues.
Literally asked yesterday as usual

https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ibf786/iphone_user_for_10_yearsthinking_about_switching/
Isn't it better to wait for 9a?
No telephoto?
I bought 8a, fingerprint works very bad. Some stuck while using it. 
Returned to the seller. 

Finger print is bed starting with 7/7a, problem solved with pixel 9 (hope 9a also)
Just create the same finger 2-3 times. Easy fix
What about Notes and Reminders you didn't find alternative in Android Ecosystem. 
I got no complaints with Google Keep and Tasks.
I would disagree with the notes and reminders side of this. Google Keep for notes and reminders is great, syncs across your devices as long as you are signed into your Google account just like notes would on iOS. I had never had an android until I switched to a pixel from a 13 mini. I thought it was very similar. 

You do raise a good point around the apple ecosystem. Hard to break free, but once you do it feels great.
I would if it launches in March as expected.
Yes it is.
It's a budget phone. Half price of the iPhone....
But if it just worked properly though.
Google Keep is missing tons of features. 

	•	Rich Text Formatting – Bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, bullet points, checklists, tables, and more.
	•	Nested Folders & Subfolders
	•	Inline Scanning & OCR
	•	Handwriting & Pencil Support
	•	Password Protection & End-to-End Encryption
	•	Rich Media Embeds / attachments – inline images, sketches, PDFs, and even web links with previews.
	•	Collapsible Headings
	•	Deep integration with OS and other devices
	•	Version History
	•	Offline Access

Google Tasks is also missing a lot

	•	Smart Lists
	•	Subtasks & Indentation
	•	Rich Text & Notes
	•	Attachments & Images – Attach photos, PDFs, and scanned documents.
	•	Location-Based Reminders
	•	Date & Time Suggestions
	•	Repeating Reminders with Advanced Options
	•	Collaboration & Task Assignments – Share lists and assign tasks to specific people.
	•	Customizable Reminders List Icons
	•	Offline Functionality
See my other post about missing features for both apps. I like Google keep and Google tasks, but… there are a lot of missing features that people coming from an iPhone might miss or need. Simple things like formatting, tables, attachments, etc. Or smart lists or location reminders. Lots more in my list.

I guess if you’ve never had any of those features, you’ll never know how useful they are.
Notes and Reminders is crazy fast and feature packed. Many startup founders would literally run their entire business on it.
Wouldn't it be better to buy previous generation flagman for even cheaper price and better performance rather than limited new model?
Upnote and TickTick are good for iOS and Android. Both require subscriptions though.
Yeah fair enough 👊
why do you say it is limited?
Because base model anything is artificially limited top model, take gpus for example",2025-01-28 15:20:36,0,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ic3we7/iphone_13_user_wanting_to_go_to_google_pixel_any/
GooglePixel,Google assistant gone completely? Gemini won't open and accept commands.,"I’ve been a dedicated Pixel user since the Pixel 3, and one of the key reasons I stuck with this ecosystem was the strong integration of Google Assistant. Unfortunately, my experience with the recent transition to Gemini has been frustrating and disappointing.

For the past few days, it feels like Google Assistant has been wiped entirely from my phone. When I use ""Hey Google,"" nothing happens except a small green mic icon in the top right corner that indicates something is listening. There’s no beep, no on-screen visuals, and, ultimately, no functionality. It seems like Gemini has taken over, and frankly, it’s failing to provide even the most basic usability I relied on.

The Gemini app no longer has an option to switch back to Google Assistant, which makes me think Assistant has been dropped entirely. If that’s the case, it’s frustrating to see such a core feature—one that made Pixel phones stand out—being phased out or replaced with something that feels incomplete.

I recently purchased a Pixel 9 Pro, but I’m seriously considering abandoning it entirely and moving over to Apple to see if the grass is greener. Beyond these issues, being a Google Workspace user makes everything even more complicated: many features are blocked or delayed, adding to my frustration.

It feels like Google is dismantling the very things that once made it great, and as a long-time Pixel fan, it’s disheartening.

Am I doing something wrong? Is there a button I have to press. Let me know please.

Comments:
Frustrated Workspace/Pixel user here too. Have you installed the standalone Assistant app? This fixed the issues for me. It allows you to set Assistant as the default, not Gemini. How long until Google kills Assistant remains to be seen.  
  
I've recently signed up for a standard Gmail account and I'm planning on moving various Google services (such as Home) away from Workspace to my new standard account, because I can't be bothered with things constantly breaking.
Have you upgraded to the Android 16 beta? I've been having some problems with it since I did that
Well, feels like you're not up to date with them news :
https://9to5google.com/2024/06/02/google-assistant-degrading-gemini-era/
In the Gemini settings, you may need to add extensions to work with various services. I believe the Utilities extension adds Assistant fallback to commands and allows it to interact with smart home devices and do things Assistant did. When it's unable, Assistant should take over.
The described issue only occurs for Workspace accounts. If you switch your account to a personal one in the Google app, ""Hey Google"" immediately starts responding normally - Gemini overlay appears. For Workspace accounts still works the swipe up from the bottom corner gesture (if you have it enabled in Settings in Gesture navigation). I think this strange behavior started when Google included Gemini (Google AI) in Workspace plans at the beginning of this year. It seems they somehow broke Gemini's integration with the legacy Google Assistant (for users logged in with Workspace accounts). As you have already noticed, all settings related to Gemini-Assistant integration are missing in Gemini app when you are logged in with Workspace account. If you switch to personal Google account in Gemini app, all these settings appear back.
Thanks a lot! That helped me. I looked into the assistant app and could set assistant to the default.
They moved the settings from Gemini to the assistant app. 

It's so annoying that they constantly move stuff around and you have to find those settings again.",2025-01-28 10:04:46,3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ibyasx/google_assistant_gone_completely_gemini_wont_open/

Compare which language you have set your phones to .
Choose English as language. Also download screenshots from APK mirror (from what I've read it the 2 solutions)
Just hold the button above volume and Gemini opens, then say in your language: make a screenshot. Also works with hey google.
Tried that already. I'll do it again with a VPN
That's not the Screenshots app, FYI

I've just came from a LineageOs Oneplus to a brand new Pixel 9 on Android15.

Is there a way to activate it somewhere without downloading an app ?
Thanks guys

We don't have it sorry.
Why not just download the app? It does the same exact thing and adds a quick tile button for it.

The app being the caffeine app.

I use this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.zhs.caffeine
you can enable the dev options in the about section of your Pixel. Thing is you can only enable a feature that allows the screen awake while charging.
Hey, it's an option to let the screen active a certain amount of time.
Yeah i will download one but I don't get why there is not a native one ;)
Thanks but not what I'm looking for :/
Well it's not a feature on stock Android. You can set the screen timeout in the settings tho
Because it's not a native android feature

GooglePixel,Sounds cuts out during quiet moments,"Looking to see if other users have experienced this issue. 

I have a Pixel Tablet and Pixel 9 Pro XL

While watching videos the sound will briefly cut out if there isn't any talking or background sound during quiet moments in shows / movies. The sound will immediately come back on when speech etc resumes but sometimes there can be a brief pause and it will miss the first second of dialogue.

I have searched and tried everything but can't find a fix. It's not a hardware or headphone issue. It feels like a setting but I can't find any answers or solutions. 

I have even tried factory resets but the issue still persists. 

Below are suggestions Google recommended. Curious if anyone has experienced this issue and if so if you have found fix. 

If your Google Pixel's sound cuts out when it's quiet, you can try these steps:
Check the battery: Make sure your Pixel Buds and charging case are charged. 
Check Bluetooth: Confirm that Bluetooth is on and that your Pixel Buds are paired with your device. 
Check the connection: Make sure your Pixel Buds are within range of your device. 
Restart your device: Restarting your phone can fix software-related issues. 
Check for updates: Install the latest software updates for your phone and Pixel Buds. 
Check your settings: Make sure your audio isn't muted, lowered, or misrouted. 
Clean your device: Gently clean your phone's speakers and microphones with a soft, lint-free cloth. 
Check your accessories: Remove any screen protectors or cases, and try using a different audio accessory. 
Reset your network settings: Resetting your network settings can fix connection issues. 
Try safe mode: Put your phone in safe mode to see if a third-party app is causing the issue. 
Factory reset: If basic troubleshooting doesn't work, you can try resetting your phone to factory settings.

GooglePixel,Pixel 9 vs 9 pro AI responsiveness ?,"Google made an interesting choice with their 9 series , reserving 2.3gb  of RAM for Gemini nano on the pros , at all times . On the vanilla  pixel 9 though , it has to allocate ram to it every time it’s called (not sure how long it remains in memory afterwards but surely doesn’t survive a reboot ) 

Do you feel it on a daily basis ? Does AI load up faster , is it any better than pixel 9 (or previous gens for that matter , though I’m still a bit confused as to which features each generation does and doesn’t get ) 

Comments:
I never really looked into that. I can say Gemini loads instantly on my 9 pro. Even after a reboot. Is there a particular thing you are doing that is slow?
nope, i dont own a pixel, im just curious
Ah ok. I doubt it's an issue. I'd test it on my sons pixel 8, but since he has a kid account it doesn't let him use gemini yet.
no worries, thank you anyway :)
i don't think it's an issue either, i'm merely curious about the perf difference and whether the allocated ram can be justifiable
Maybe if you are trying to use a gemini in the middle of an already ram intensive task running? I could see that making a difference.",2025-01-27 22:19:40,0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1iblwcx/pixel_9_vs_9_pro_ai_responsiveness/

GooglePixel,Why Pixel?,"As a Samsung user, the Pixel 9 intrigues me but the bare bones software makes me second guess it. Why would you say Pixel is superior to Samsung?

Edit: I should clarify that by bare bones software I more mean how it's less customizable than One UI. 

Comments:
Not superior really but the barebones software is a plus. No bloatware. Faster OS updates.
The camera is way better both in terms of aesthetics and taking pictures of moving objects.

The software doesn't matter. Nobody is buying a S25 Ultra because they really want to use Samsung's apps lol. I have a S24U and I use exactly zero Samsung apps aside from Good Lock because everything has a much better alternative.
I have been a Samsung user since the s3 and touchwiz. I've owned many Samsung devices. I recently switched to the 9 and I'm blown away. Not having the 2 apps has been amazing Don't get me wrong Samsung makes great product. But this is the best phone I've ever owned and it just works and flows so seamlessly. The camera is incredible it's just about the perfect phone.  You would not be disappointed and you will probably end up having the same sentiment as myself. I hope this helps. Of you use voice functions alot I would also highly recommend the voice recognition software is stunning.
You call Pixel ""bare bones"", we call Samsung ""bloated"".

The software you seem to like, is literally the reason we avoid Samsung like the plague.
S24+ user here but had Pixels in the past.  Sometimes I miss the vanilla Android experience.
I like Pixels because they offer the most ""iPhone like"" Android experience in my opinion, as in it just works with no fuss, and everything feels super responsive and fluid. Every other Android phone I've owned in the past came with a load of duplicate and borderline useless apps, an ugly interface, and features that I personally considered to be more of a gimmick than actually useful. I've never owned a Samsung phone, I'm sure they’re good, but there’s nothing that attracts me to them over a Pixel.
The only reason why NOT pixel is customization and actual powerful features like modes and routines. I love the flexibility afforded to me by my Samsung, but everything else is just more fluid and just sort of works over on the pixel side. Definitely more of the iphone of android, if that makes sense.
Bare bones software 🤨

Ever get spam calls and text? 
Not on Pixel. 

Send a message via satellite when there's no cell coverage?  Not on Samsung (yet)

Try it.  You'll love it
camera is significantly better. settings menus are much easier to navigate and find stuff. that you can learn over time though. whether it's superior... it is to a lot of people and not to others. the cutdown bloatware many many people like when going to pixel.
Barebones is a big advantage with the Pixel. 

Add what you want, not what Samsung wants...
I'm with you brother, I also have the Pixel 9 Pro and the s24 Ultra because I work in phone tech support and I like to have a broad range of experience. 

One handed operation Plus alone is a deal breaker for me going to any other phone. It's just so intuitive.  Then there's just little stuff like the built-in equalizer, and the ability to change volume steps so you can have super precise control of Bluetooth speakers and the like.  The ability to customize so much.  Settings are better.  Quick launch is better.

Pixel has Now Playing and a faster camera with what I consider better tuning.
Switched after 11 years with Samsung. The camera is way way better. Way less spam calls is another huge bonus. Plus screen calling. The playing now feature is also super useful and fun! I like the design of the 9 Pro way more than any of the galaxy models. Google tends to extend the years of support offered on old phones. As well as offer extended warranties for known manufacture errors like screens dying. Samsung has never. The support and extended warranties are a huge reason to pick google in my opinion. I don't game heavy and also have another device for that. The last reason that made switching seem right for me. Is that google does not push out updates that make most of their older phones and still newer ones not work. My s21U was only 3 years old and became unusable after updates. For how expensive it was. That is not acceptable to me. The phone should work almost perfectly still. I am having way less issues with reception on my Pixel 9 Pro.
It's not so much ""bare bones"" as it is, not bloated...
i wouldn't call the Pixel's Android ""barebones"", since putting it against the most basic copy of Android out there, aka the AOSP's Generic System Image, you'll find its actually heavily modified. and out of the box, the Pixel will have most, if not all of the apps you'd probably need to use (except an MP3 player...) and its generally fairly simple to use.  i also decided to check out a few Galaxy's when at a store, and i just felt like their UI was... I don't know, i just found it to be a bit off. idk if its because im used to Samsungs running Touchwiz, but i just didn't feel like it worked nicely. i do find the Pixel's UI to be pretty nice, tho. might just be personal preference. i guess see if a store has them on display and give them a try.




3/10 windows phone better (fly high WP)
Samsung's OS is bloated which is why many people like pixel. To be honest Samsung does make better phones, almost everything is better. But pixel users know that pixels aren't top of the line, but it's not noticeable one bit and the simplicity is great
I just made the step from a S10e to Pixel 9 Pro. The 5x  48mp camera in a ""smaller phone"" is the only reason I switched. If I did not care about that I would not have switched.
It works, intuitive design unlike in Samsung, goes straight to the point unlike again, Samsung.
If you're asking this question, you don't know...
Maybe the question is why not Samsung?

I used Samsung phone before and apart from the short update cycle. The overall quality and durability of their products fell short of my expectations.
This is exactly why for me
Came here to say this. I have a hand me down s22 base. Idk if you can even flask pixel experience on it, I bricked the a52 I tried, so I'm not gonna, but man, I just want a barebones android to tinker with. So many Samsung apps and notifications I can't get rid of.
I 1000th this notion. When I think about the ""customization"" aspect of Samsung devices, I just didn't find myself wanting to bother with all of that after so long..then, I started realizing how long it takes Samsung devices to get the latest versions of Android. 

Pixels are always prioritized to get first dibs. Also, the camera is second to none in my opinion. And not having extra Samsung bloatware is a major plus. All of these reasons and more are why I don't really go with Samsung. That and, I'd rather go with Google since they're in charge of Android at its core. 

So, the experience provided on the Pixels is the cleanest way to experience it. Of course you can make it as crazy as you want through apps and other tinkering (this coming from an avid tinkerer who used to flash custom ROMs for customization like crazy). 

However, once I got my hands on the Pixel 6, there was just something so appealing about the experience Google had crafted in these phones. I prefer it over Samsung's approach. 

And that's not to say that Samsung phones aren't fantastic. It's just when I look past the hardware itself and consider the experience altogether, I'm not a fan.
It has bloatware aplenty, its just Google's very own bloatware.  30% of the homescreen being mandated to be Google widgets is worse in my opinion than bundling a bunch of apps I have to disable and uninstall one time when I set up my phone initially.

Faster OS updates... But with things that Samsung already has. Everything in Pixel's feature drops and subsequent ""new"" Android 15 update already existed on Galaxy. (App pairs, 80% charge limits, secure folder). Even things I'm waiting for on my pixel 8 like Auracast (expected to be in Android 16) already exist on my s23.
+1 to this. I don’t think there is anything in which pixel excels other than camera. Samsung has routines just like automations on iOS. I wouldn’t call one ui bloated at all, it’s good to have choices. I guess this is a pixel subReddit so calling oneui bloated is permissible.
Facts.
As a person who has had Google phones since the original Nexus, the Pixel is plenty bloated, worse probably than a Samsung phone.  I havent had a Samsung phone since the original Galaxy, but I understand that they bundle a few apps that no one wants with their phones nowadays?  It is also my understanding that you can run one single adb command to remove all of it on the device without root.  

What is the command to remove At a Glance and the Google search widget on a Pixel?  And installing Nova Launcher and dealing with the gesture delay is not an adequate fix.
With pixel you need a third party app to do literally everything... Can't even dim the flashlight without one. IOS can do this. 
Its what Google wants... Evident by the stupid widgets you can't remove without a launcher... 
That's why they're asking numbnuts
Every ""fan"" here keeps harping on the ""latest version of android"" but doesnt realize that it just means you get the privilege of getting features that Samsung already has... Look what you got in Android 15? A bunch of things Samsung had 2 generations ago. 
I don't use 90% of the 'features' my phone has already.
Anything outside of 5-7 Google apps is bloat apparently.... 
Interesting take.

Last Samsung I had needed to be rooted to get rid of ANYTHING, and still couldn't effectively get rid of some of it. 

But I've been all Pixel for years, so maybe I'm not informed.
The same iOS that got Swype 5 years late? How's the magic eraser working for you?

Different platforms do things and get things differently.  But we're talking about Pixel vs Samsung here.  Apple is a different conversation.
Yeah that's cool. But it also introduces new features. Let's not act like Samsung always has these features before the big official releases,now. Be foreal
OK... Part of the supposed appeal of pixels is the latest Android version... I'm just saying they often add things that aren't actually new but things that already exist on other OEMS.


Edit: Yup downvote bc it's true... 
They're bloat because they're forced on you and you can't remove them for no reason other than Samsung wants them there.

They literally bloat your list of apps.

run through adb to remove all of the bloatware.  That was for an S23, so I don't know if that still translates to an S24 and later.  I'd assume those would have commands of their own, similar but different.
Made the point about ios since id say its the baseline for features. But Samsung can also dim the flash in quick settings. And Magic eraser has also existed on Galaxy as object erase. Try removing the background of a photo on pixel... You can't. Both iOS and oneUI can do this.... 
Bro I haven't touched your post and you edited in your snark (meaning you were *actively checking your imaginary internet points* before I even saw the notification.


Acquire a hobby.
How is that different from Google TV,  meet, and photos being preinstalled?... The only bloat by that definition is the Galaxy Store and Samsung Internet... Everything else can be uninstalled. 
So sorry you can't dim the flash lol

I know object eraser is on the others - finally.  Pixel had it first. 

The background thing is cool though.

Back to my point.  Different phones get different things at different times.

Samsung is bloated.  That's the topic.
Head to your apps in settings and search for Samsung. Those aren't the only two apps you're stuck with. I have multiple pages of apps I can't uninstall on my S24U. I just hide them with a launcher.

Also, I didn't say anything about the Google apps. That said, people mind less because the Google versions of those apps are generally the ones you'd want to use for their purpose anyway. Not always, but generally. Especially in comparison to the Samsung equivalent.
Ok samsung had basically everything your pixel got with android 15. All the ai jank on pixels and no bg remove sucks... To your last point, what's the bloatware?  First party apps? 
Multiple pages?... Name a few. And You shouldn't need to hide them (something you also can't do on pixel) since u can disable it. (I don't, consider things like the dialer and calendar, contacts as bloat)
Hiding the apps is a function of the launcher, not of OneUI. You can do the same thing on a Pixel.

Samsung Internet, Samsung TV Plus, Samsung Pass, Samsung Checkout, Galaxy Store, Samsung Cloud, Samsung Visit In, Samsung Visual Cloud Core, etc.
You can delete TV, pass doesn't exist (its wallet) and can be deleted, store (wouldn't say thats bloat), Cloud and cloud core are used to backup the stock apps... Visit-in yes that's bloat (can be disabled). Also Ik hiding is on the launcher side I meant you can do that on OneUI but not the default pixel launcher. (I don't use launchers since they mess with animations). 


Edit: Mixed up pass with pay... But i wouldn't say that's bloat. I mean If you hate everything with Samsung infront of it Idk what to tell you... 
No I can't delete TV.

https://ibb.co/K9HQ3Fq

It doesn't matter what apps I like/hate or why. I paid for the phone, I own it and I should be able to delete any app I want. That's really as far as this goes.
Yeah I agree...  Cant remember if that was the case for me but I did put my phone through adb years ago.",2025-01-28 01:20:09,0,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ibpwf7/why_pixel/
GooglePixel,Gemini app rolling out ‘Talk Live about this’ on Pixel 9,"

Comments:
While Google software locks its AI features to its newest phones even though spec wise it can work on any phone, chynaa is open sourcing its bootlegged ChatGPT for the whole world. Get it together google, other pixels are more than capable of running all aspects of Gemini.
Funny I got this on my Galaxy Tab S9 before getting it on my Pixel 8 Pro. Still running on the November Play Update even.
I'm a bit late but I just got this and played with it. 

The back-and-forth conversation was bad.  Multiple times it wouldn't recognize I said something back.  Another time I responded to a prompt in the conversation with the word ""time"" and it spoke back to me with the current time.  Another time I asked it to repeat the last thing and it just sat there and did nothing. 

It feels broken.  Big surprise.
yea bro all these companies are full of shit 

Idk I can't really tell if they're actually full of shit or just incompetent
¿Porque no los dos?
Tactically full of shit. It makes people buy the newer phones. They keep doing it year after year with Photos features.
Intentionally. They want people buying new phones every year, so they have to limit features.

GooglePixel,"Custom roms for Pixel 9, What to try?","Recently got my Pixel 9 and curious what custom roms I should try out.  
Last 10 years or so I've worked with Lineage OS on my old Poco F1, and then was stuck on samsungs' rom for a bit with a s21 before switching to iphone 15. The iphone is my work phone, and the pixel 9 is just for android specific things and fun really.

I use a dedicated separate account for it so privacy focused options like grapheneos isn't really important.  
I want features, customization, performance, etc; Don't need NFC, google pay, or cellular service as it's just a wifi phone mainly. Notes, reading, pictures, etc;  
Would like work profile, user switching, and android 15 based for private space. Really handy being able to have multiple apps open without user switching.

Comments:
GrapheneOS since privacy is your primary concern.
What about going to xda? Did you manage to do that?

There're currently 2 ROMs. Try them out. 

Performance has never been the reason to get a ROM, it's usually either way worse or slightly worse. You can root your stock rom with magisk and get whatever modules you want.
I miss some info in my post, but privacy is not a primary concern since it isn't my main phone and I use a dedicated junk account for it.  
Features, utilities, QOL, and performance is my main things.
A friend of mine managed to get ad blocking phone wide.  No ads.  Fucking sick.  But not sure how he did it.  I'm assuming a different rom
THAT sounds awesome. I'm guessing root with adaway maybe or something in that realm.

Hi everyone,

GooglePixel,Does anyone else think the current pixel 9 design language would lend itself quite well to a Pixel Flip?,"So I was just wondering what a potential Pixel Flip could look like and created a rough 3d model trying to incorporate design elements form the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro Fold.

  
[https://imgur.com/a/B4bBm3p](https://imgur.com/a/B4bBm3p)

What do you think a potential Flip could look like?

Comments:
I'm buying a pixel flip instantly the day it comes out.

Love the pixel line and software, love the folding form factor
I love how that looks. I'd get one if I wasn't scared of foldables having decreased durability.
At first I hated this design, but the more I see it, the more I love it.
I like the general idea but don't like the camera bar taking up so much room as it shows in the concept. 

Gib me more outer sceeen

Also the camera bar looks like it sticks out quite a bit still, just seems like it would be weird like that when folded.
The only reason I don't already have a foldable phone is because I'm waiting for a Pixel Flip. If Apple beats Google to the punch, I might consider switching (I haven't had an iPhone since 2012).
That's a very unrealistic concept design. You forgot the G logo.
The problem is that it does not look like pixel, the new pixel 9 series already look like Samsungs, this looks even more like Samsung flip phone.
Same
My partner is in the same boat.  She's rocking my old P5 because it's smaller than most phones.  She's been eyeing the Razr flip but wants to stay in the Pixel Ecosystem, so she's just waiting for it.
Fold and flip are not the same concept. I think flip is going down fold is going up in acquisition rates.
I am with you on this.  I have the 4a which is currently having a ton of issues and the recent update destroyed battery life so I need a new phone ASAP which sucks because if the Pixel Flip were out right now, I'd buy it so quickly.  Considering how boring phones are getting, the idea of getting yet another candy bar form factor phone that will just feel like my 4a leaving me wondering where my money went to, at least with a Flip it's an entirely new experience and since I don't want to use my phone at all, having the small screen means I can get things done without opening it up to all the distracting options inside.
Why does it look like a Samsung?
Flat edges? If so, now all phones have this design.
Yeah the Moto flip phones would have been my go to if it was running the Pixel software natively honestly
I mean the phone still folds :>
Well, that's the problem, and a flip phone with flat edges currently well known is only Samsung, so first impression was Samsung Flip phone newer gens. Pixel were meant to have curves and not flat design, they were special in their looks not boring and same as others. It is same with cars, how does one car become more special, it is not because it is same as others, it differs and in good way. Pixel 8 was one of the peaks In this idea , nice curves which thought about the ergonomics, it is BS that flat edges are better for ergonomics, and nice camera bump which won't let the phone shake, also very nice haptics, and of course, wonderful cameras, basic software. Now what left Is cameras, software and haptics, and, ok, display.
Wow, your answer has changed my point of view, it's true that the Pixel 8 is really different from the others, it stands out from the others and is really very beautiful (I have the Pixel 8) but I have to admit that I I like the flat edges but for the grip, it's not pleasant.
Pixels were meant to have curves? No such thing.

What Pixels were meant to have are a wedge design and no camera bump.
Well with curves I meant wedges, and they now have removed them and now start to look more closer to Samsung s series which are just sleeker looking a series which are just a current trend where you could definitely find a phone for 100 euros with very close to same design. I mean, they are in some ways like iphone 4, but bigger and with a camera bump.",2025-01-27 19:46:05,29,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ibi4ke/does_anyone_else_think_the_current_pixel_9_design/
GooglePixel,Bug - Volume Buttons suddenly can't snooze Alarms,"*** EDITED to say: I spoke too soon regarding a fix - I thought it was fixed by an update to the Google app today, February 3rd - but the bug returned February 4th ***

For years, I've snoozed my Clock alarm by pressing the physical volume buttons, but a day or so ago it stopped working. 

I've searched for answers to this bug and found the suggestion to turn off Google Assistant Quick Phrases, which does seem to fix the problem, but then I lose the Quick Phrases functionality.

The weird thing is, this bug doesn't occur on my husband's Pixel 9 Pro, which is pretty much the same as mine, same carrier and everything. It also doesn't occur on my old Pixel 8 which is currently only on Wi-Fi and under my same Google account as my Pixel 9 Pro. 

Any other suggestions for how to fix this issue? I tried deleting all data and updates from the Clock app itself but that didn't fix anything.

Comments:
This is happening to me too.
I'll try that. The volume button snooze is more important to me than the quick phrase.
Can you switch to Gemini and see if this solves the issue? Seems to me like GA is the culprit here.
Same here with pixel 9 pro. Hope they fix this soon!
Hi there, could you test in [safe mode](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2852139) to see if any third party app is causing the issue or not?

If it works fine in safe mode, it means a 3rd party app is causing the issue. Temporarily remove them one by one, starting with the most recent until you find the cause.

Additionally, you can reach out to the Google Pixel support team via phone or chat[ here](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/gethelp). They can take a look at it.
Awesome thanks!
Weird. For now I have Quick Phrases disabled, but it's annoying to not be able to use it.

Thank you but this doesn't help because Safe Mode disables Quick Phrases in Google Assistant, which is the app that is causing the bug. So yes the alarm problem goes away in Safe Mode but only because Google Assistant is disabled, not because of a third party app.

When Quick Phrases is disabled then the Volume Buttons can snooze the Alarm. Safe Mode disables Quick Phrases by disabling Google Assistant altogether.

I have been having the same issue as well recently. Followed the steps posted here [in this post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/s/vPJRpKceT7) 

It did not work at first. Tried all steps again and rebooted phone one more time and it appears to be working now. 

Hopefully this helps.
Honestly I'm not using Gemini. Preplexity AI has enabled its voice assistant and to my surprise I can do pretty much anything with it (from streaming a movie, playing a specific track on Spotify and the sorts)
Just thought the same. Still broken.
Haha. The volume button snooze is working for me, but only after the work around you mentioned.
This allows you to snooze the alarm using the volume buttons? 

I just tried all of the steps in the link you posted including 2 reboots but the volume buttons still won't snooze the alarm when Quick Phrases is enabled. Darn, I was hoping this was the solution.
Yeah, disabling Quick Phrases still fixes it
Yeah so far it seems to be working again after trying the steps posted. I have quick phrases enabled as well.
I'm glad it worked for you, but sadly not for me. Thanks for the suggestion though.

I tried the process once more with even more restarts but nope, the volume buttons still can't snooze the alarm if Quick Phrases is enabled. Annoying.
Happiness was short lived. It is no longer working. Very annoying

GooglePixel,Exclusive: Here's How Much The Google Pixel 9a Will Cost,"

Comments:
Spoiler:

128gb: $499

256gb: $599
I'll do what I've done with my last two a-series devices and wait for it to go on sale like two weeks after launch.
$100 more than it needs to be, but I guess they need the cushion for discounts.
Definitely too much. Just like last year, it will cost within 50 bucks of the Pixel 9. I don't really understand why anyone would buy the 9a instead or why Google launches it at a time in which it competes with its own phones.  
The price would be ok, if the Pixel 9 wasn't so cheap 6 months after release
make it small, light and give it a headphone jack and I'm buying it instantly. I miss my P4a
Consider the following. This phone will ship with the Tensor G4 but Pixel 8 modem. The Pixel 10a will ship with the Tensor G4 again, and you better hope it gets the Pixel 9 modem. It will need it for SOS.
Too much?
Gross it's gotten even larger. Give us a small a series. Can barely fit them in my pocket at this point.
Nothing in this story about the modem, but earlier reports said the 9a will have the modem from the 8 series. I'd wait for reports on modem reception before buying this one, IMO. Maybe Google was able to improve it somehow.
Definitely gonna wait for the sale on this one.
They'll probably be bundled with prepaid carriers and stuff for 99 bucks. I remember the Pixel 6A was $50 from MetroPCS but you had to buy a $40 plan. It wouldn't unlock for 6 months though but still
I bought a 8 pro fro 599 lmao
Any estimate on how much the 8a will cost after 9a is released? 
Is 9a better than 9?
...with incentives, that price point will attract a lot of users to be honest.
Is this a good move from the 6A?
I think I'll upgrade my 8a to 9a, with the processor & camera upgrade.  But I'll wait for the price drop. And pick it up for $300 or so.  I'll keep my 8a as a backup.
Way too much. And why are we offering a ""Pro"" phone with the same starting storage as an ""A"" phone?
It should have been: 

256GB: $499
Damn, can't wait to see how banging the 9a is going to be that they price it at the same as a OnePlus 13R with twice the storage.
Thanks, hopefully that cuts into traffic for the clickbait site.
Made me think it's insane to buy current gen phones nowadays
When they give you a killer trade in. That's what I've done last two times
And trade-ins.
The MSRP is pretty crazy but I think the allure of the A series is buying them on a steep discount 2-6 months after they release.

I just got my 8a for $170 after trading in my 6a, which I bought outright a couple years ago for $300. I definitely wouldn't of bought either at full price.
Sure if you buy msrp with no discounts or higher valued trades. But pretty much everyone will get one at a discount or get above-market trade in value.
Well the 9a is going to be even bigger yet.  For me, the whole allure of the A series was the size and price.  My 4 year old P4a is 5.8"", was ~$400, and it's perfect.  Almost every A series phone since has been 6.1"", and now the 9a will be 6.3"".  Sticking with my P4a until it explodes
I don't get why people are still pining for headphone jacks. Modern wireless earbuds are amazing, and just so much more useful in most everyday situations.

And if you do find yourself in a place where you can sit down and don't mind the extra wires, then plug your headphones into the USB-C port. That's what it is meant for.
The 9a isn't getting the Exynos 5400?????
It really shouldn't be any higher than $400 for the base model. Hell, I don't even think the 256GB version should be more than $450. The camera hardware is downright unimpressive too.
Yes, hard pass if it's using the modem from the 8.
Everybody complains about every pixel modem and says they're waiting for the next one... So who is buying pixels? Were there any good ones sprinkled in?
No, that's the whole point.
waiting for a 10a or even 11 seems more responsible. Unless you break your phone.

Upgrading within a single generation would net no significant improvements especially between 8-9.
Why is it way too much? I know people want a cheaper phone but if you think about the pricing strategy, it does create segmentation.

* 9a: $499
* 9: $799
* 9 Pro: $999
* 9 Pro XL: $1099

Is the appropriate comparison iPhone SE at $429?
How is 499 for the 9a too much? Isnt that on line with other a phones?
Because why put more storage on a phone when they offer cloud services? This way they can charge you every month for the rest of your life!
Yes but to me it's kind of a moot point. These phones are not meant to be bought at launch at least in my opinion. They're meant to be bought 13 months after they come out for 200 bucks on Amazon renewed.

All of that said I would think a better deal is just buying The Pixel 8 pro renewed on Amazon for 350 or the Pixel 7 pro with 512 GB brand new it woot for $399.
I'm pretty sure my 5a was $499 when new
I regret getting the 128GB P9 Pro now. I should’ve bumped up the storage and not be a cheapskate.
If they bump to 256 with no price increase no one would care about that, but many of us don't need lots of on board storage if everything is backed up so I'd rather a 128 still be available if it keeps the price down a bit.
Saying 'trade in' narrows the possible countries you're from from about 200 to 1.
I still can't believe how good of a deal I got on my 3a trade-in when I bought this 6a
Fair enough, if that works for you. I don't personally trade-in devices.
I paid about the same amount for my 8a, and I traded in a 4a which was heavily discounted when I bought it years ago.
Yes this is what I was saying. Not even 6 months after release but 18 months after release. These things get updated for seven freaking years. You can buy a Pixel 6 pro for 180 bucks a pixel 7 pro for $275 on Amazon renewed and a pixel 8 pro for 350. 

I mean if you don't want the telephoto take $50 off those numbers and buy the base models
How did you get the 8a for such a low price? I'm looking to do the exact same swap
USB-C ports are meant for headphone jacks? That's news to me.

If you have nice headphones you want a headphone jack. I still have my Xperia that has a headphone jack. It works.  I have bluetooth issues with my 7a, but in general bluetooth isn't and never will be as reliable or as clear as wired headphones.
It's choice, I like both, I prefer my IEMs most of the time, even when commuting. Let me choose what I want to use and when, that's the whole point of android, isn't it?

You don't get that people might think differently than you, it's a hard concept to grasp, but people like different things.

For me, TWS are almost pointless, although I use them from time to time.
Likely 5300i or some further die-shrunk variant
Pixel 9 series modem is excellent. We have three of them now. Switched from the 8 series which wasn't amazing, but better than the 7 series and certainly the 6 series. 

Could depend on your carrier, etc. I'm in a suburb of Toronto on one of our national major carriers and I often found myself without signal on the 6 and 7 series when others did. The 8 series I usually had a connection. But calls would consistently drop. None of that since I got the 9 Pro.
I agree, except that ""Google might apparently use Tensor G4 on the Pixel 10a as a possible cost-cutting measure.""

EDIT TO ADD:

The G4 uses Exynos 5400 modem which is a big improvement over the Exynos 5300i modem in the G3.  I have some connectivity issues in my area.

G4 is about 25% faster than the G3

And that 9a has better (dual?) sensors for the camera, so should be a nice boost.

I think the 9a has some really nice enhancements over the 8a overall.  And since the 10a might use the 4 anyways then I'll go ahead and fold.

EDIT 2:

The 9a might not get the upgraded modem... TBD
The current SE is pretty old and won’t hold a candle to 9A.

The new budget iPhone coming out any second now is the dangerous one; Apple jerking themselves into making sure it can do AI crap means it’s accidentally spec’d higher than their normal budget offerings and will eat sales from every direction, MMW.
You'll never convince me that a Pro is $500 better than an A.
Think Samsung is a better comp than iPhone. The 9a @ $499 would seem to fit well in between the A35 ($399) and S24 FE ($649).
Because a OnePlus 13R is 499 and they give you a free watch.  And it has twice the storage.  And a multiple generations better processor.  And almost for sure a better display.  And faster charging.  And much better battery life.  And on and on and on.
In theory, yes. But you can buy the 9 for a bit cheaper than 799
Great deal in my book. Google usually offers a $100 discount at times.
$500.00+Tax is almost $640.00 which is too much for a 128gb Android smartphone w/o an SD card slot.
Yeah but. 128 extra in flesh is $100 more, and I rarely feel it's not enough even with all the photos and videos in original quality on board. 200 extra in cloud is $100/5 years which is longer than any of my android phones survived.

And these 200 are sharable between 5 extra users and numerous devices.

If the cloud storage is a cash grab attempt they seriously shoot in the own leg.
When you trade in your old phone, the extra storage isn't going to increase the money that you'll get back. That means, any premium paid for more storage is a consumable cost. If you truly need more local storage, then of course, that's what you gotta do. But I found that Android has gotten pretty good with using the cloud and I have a hard time justifying this extra cost.
Bumping 128gb storage to 256gb will literally cost them only a few bucks in materials, and there is no extra manufacturing or research cost involved because it's just a slightly more expensive storage chip putting into exactly the same place.

Keeping base storage as 128gb won't ""keep the price down a bit"", it's not like now they will suddenly charge you 994 instead of 999, it's still going to be fucking 999 bucks.

The only reason they don't give you 256gb base storage is so they can charge you $100 more for it.
These companies aren't hurting for cash they can do better it's just that with the government we have in the U.S. why would they? LG is gone and Huawei got banned. There's no competition besides OnePlus which isn't in carrier stores anymore.
Same trade I made
What do you do with the dozens of old phones that you have lying around, that don't get updates any more, and that slowly suffer from their batteries dying?

While I think the entire concept of selling expensive phones and then offsetting the cost by offering huge trade-in discounts is a bit surreal, as a consumer, upgrading every two to three years has proven to be surprisingly inexpensive over the years. I wonder what they do with all those old devices.
I'm in the US and use Spectrum, they have a deal right now where it's $200 off and then an extra $100 credit for whatever device you trade in, the pixel 6a they valued at $30 so the total credit was $130 for trading in. Without the trade in, it would still only be 300. I figured it was about same I would've gotten it for selling the 6a myself.
You can get inexpensive adapters that allow you to plug any old-school headphone directly into your USB-C jack. And considering that many people were OK with the often mediocre DACs that came built into phones, there really is no downside.

On the other hand, since you are obviously OK with having to deal with extra cables, this is your opportunity to invest in high-end external DACs. There is a whole market for portable high quality USB-C to 3.5mm adapters.

You can go pick from anything between a $5 no-name adapter to $500+ high-fidelity gear. Take your pick.

Honestly, this discussion is getting a bit old. Time has moved on. There really isn't any discernible advantage to built-in 3.5mm sockets. We solved this problem years ago.
Yes, the standard was designed for many uses including audio. 

usbc is bit perfect audio, it's objectively better than an audio jack. Just get a small adapter if you already have nice headphones, problem solved.
And as I said, if you do prefer wired headphones (i.e. IEMs), then go ahead use them. Nothing stops you. Your phone has a USB-C port and you can plug them into that. And in fact, if you spend a little more money on good DAC, you probably get much better fidelity than anything you had previously gotten out of the mediocre built-in DACs that you had with the phone's 3.5mm jack. Why do you want to go back to that?
iPhone budget edition is still coming with some shortcomings like 1 lens, 60hz screen. I am in market for new phone but wait for new generation of devices - Nothing phone 3a, Pixel 9a, Oneplus nord 5, Pixel 9a and iPhone SE. So far im closest to buying nord5 with pixel 9a close second.
Welcome to the law of diminishing returns.
I think the problem is Pixels are just too good already. It all comes down to the camera, and if even older IMX386 module based cameras are already comparable, Google hasn't created good value.

I've frequently questioned how Pro is $300 (now $200 only because they have a smaller Pro now) more than the regular phone? A slightly better refresh rate, slightly better screen that only us nerds will appreciate, and a telephoto is hardly worth the $300 difference, and the difference keeps shrinking. Previously it was 90 Hz, but now the Pixel 9 has 120 Hz, and the display quality is actually amazing now with 2 years-in-a-row of substantial improements.

If anything Google relies heavily on that Gemini Advanced offer to sell the Pro because hardware wise, it's not truly a $200 premium.

The same issue with the a-series phone and vanilla. It's hard to justify this $300 difference between Pixel 9 and 9a. Maybe the hardware is worse on the a-series, but the camera is like 95% of the way there most of the time.
Actually, the vanilla Pixel is 500 bucks better than the A. The only probably is that Google won't admit the A series ain't worth $499 at launch, but more like $299, or $349 at most. 
I haven't been keeping up with phone specs, those Galaxy S Fan Editions are the equivalent of the Pixel A? With that price, are the spec concessions not as conservative as Pixel?
Last year the 12R was a much better deal than the 8A too. 16 GB sku even. 80 watt charger in the box.
OnePlus 13 is just a bunch of half baked ideas with bugs that are just unacceptable. For example, turn on Always On Display and set it to ""All Day"". It doesn't matter what you do, that phone will just decide nope, no more AOD for you. Nothing you can do about it and the bug has been around for generations of their phones without a fix. In my two days with the phone I found multiple bugs that have been around for generations. Screw that man. I ain't got time for that.
Worse pictures unfortunately.
Agreed, it's always on sale. I just used MSRP because it's the most fair way to compare across the board.
Unless you don't like paying for cloud services. 

Just give me back my removable SD card and the majority of these discussions go away.
Yeah I’m at 89% now which is kinda odd since I never got close to the 256 models I’ve had before.  I guess it’s been such a great experience I’m taking way more and photos and videos and installed more games.
>The only reason they don't give you 256gb base storage is so they can charge you $100 more for it.

I'm aware of why they do it, and that's exactly why it's delusional to think they would add more for no extra cost, because as far as I've seen all the major players start at 128 and charge more for extra storage. So where is this coming from that they would magically bump the storage without a price increase? 

As I said, go ahead if it costs the same, but until you show me proof they wouldn't raise the cost of the base price I'm not for it, simple as that. We don't all need tons of storage and I don't want to have to pay more because others don't just choose the 256 version who need it. 

Samsung has a double storage offer as did Google when the 9 series launched. Yeah it's extra storage for the same price for that 'few extra bucks' it costs for the raw material, but you're losing the free hardware from the other releases like the watch or the buds on the pixel side, so Google still come out top financially. 

Again, show me they wouldn't charge for the privilege of double storage at the base tier and I'll happily rescind my opinion, but the above offer just shows they aren't going to do it for nothing, proving my point further.
Dozens? You think they have 24 old phones laying around the house. 

Lol. 

Honestly there's really no reason to trade in a phone in my opinion because if you just wait a year the new pixel is going to be 30 cents on the dollar 

Instead of trading in a phone to get the Pixel 9 pro XL at $1, 200... Minus whatever I get for say a pixel 7 or something...

Just buy the Pixel 8 pro for $350 renewed. Pixel 7 pro right now is 512 GB and 399 brand new at woit with a 90-day warranty.

And then you can keep your Pixel 7 or Pixel 8 or whatever (but you're still going to be updated for another 5 and 1/2 years in the case of the Pixel 8 end two and a half years in the case of the pixel 7)
I just don't buy dozens of phones, I suppose. I've carried a cell phone every day for 20 years and (I just added them up), I've had 9 personal devices.

My one work phone lasted about 7 years (I miss Casio). Old, stock Pixels are still really useful as USB/wifi cameras/webcams & my PXL backs up photos occasionally. The only reason I'm not still using my 4a with an updated ROM flash is because the (affected) battery failed so quickly and I snagged a new, unlocked replacement device for basically 150 bucks off retail exactly when I needed it. Now, I definitely need to replace that battery but the only other device that I've had a battery issue with was a Blackberry & figuring out how to safely dispose of that was also how I learned about our local e-waste program 🤘

But, yeah, at this point, it's genuinely baffling practice considering how well these things can totally work if they are able to be kept updated and maintained but it gives the idiots singularly focused on growth new numbers to reference every year, so I guess they'll keep offering trade-in spiffs forever until we're completely up to our assholes in unnecessarily manufactured & destroyed heavy metal wastefulness.
> dozens of old phones

lmao this sub is really something
> usbc is bit perfect audio, it's objectively better than an audio jack

lol what

it's as 'bit perfect' as the integrated dac, but with an annoying stiff dongle
DACs barely make a difference, unless you have the shittiest source (I currently use a CX31993 on my work laptop), IEMs are really easy to drive.

Yes, I can grab the dongle I already own, but I would rather just plug it straight into the phone, like I do with every other device except my work laptop, because most jacks were/are good enough. Like I do with my PC, with my personal laptop, with my steam deck, and like I did with my pixel 4a, a year ago.

Not to mention, most USB dongles I tried aren't great at staying connected, USB C always disconnects even by just walking, and for some reason are really annoying to have on the pocket, compared to just a cable connected directly into the phone.

They could also give another USB C, but I just want headphones, I would rather just have an audio jack again, I never asked for it to be removed.

Why wouldn't I go back to that? For me, TWS are annoying, I would rather just grab a cable, plug it in and be ready to go without worrying about anything.
They've started locking software features to the more expensive Pro model too such as Video Boost.
I'm not an expert, just picked the two closest phones in price off of Samsung's website and compared them to the 8a on a few review/benchmarking sites. Most reviews had the A35 as being slightly inferior and the S24 as slightly superior.
No one is claiming that there aren't bugs here and there or features that don't work the way you'd want them to.  But to minimize OxygenOS as a ""bunch of half baked ideas"" is ridiculous.  It is a much more pleasant OS looks wise than PixelOS, and has an insane amount of customizations compared to the Pixel.  It also has a nearly endless amount of quality of life features available that again the Pixel lacks.  Luckily I don't use always on display, so that bug or design decision from OnePlus doesn't bother me.  Apparently in my very light googling after reading your comment, it appears to be OnePlus decided if the phone senses complete darkness it turns off Always On Display, so it seems like just a different implementation vs a bug.  There is a bug that does bother me with folders, but its not that big of a deal.  The auto-brightness instead of adaptive brightness is annoying.  Neither of these are as annoying as the At-a-Glance widget on my homescreen for the Pixel.

All that said, it isn't even close when comparing OxygenOS to PixelOS.  I'll take the OS with the million features and a couple bugs instead of the OS that is ugly and featureless but less buggy.  Especially when I get to save hundreds of dollars and get much much better hardware in the process.  And a free watch.
We will see.  I'll look forward to the comparisons.
I wish. I had 128gb in my phones 10 years ago using those cards.
Or your photos and videos are just getting larger and larger with the newer image sensors and all the added bloat from the various things the camera app does.
I wouldn't recommend buying renewed devices. They might work for you, but then in my experience from talking to friends/family, they also might not. The chances of catastrophic failure after a few months are considerably lower when buying a factory-new device. Not that there is anything wrong with used devices in principle, but for ""renewed"" devices there often is a reason why they were returned and then refurbished.

I am not saying you should buy a device at MSRP either. But you can frequently get huge discounts, and if you combine those with trade-ins, you can get a brand-new device that came out less than a year ago and pay less than $200. I just upgraded from a 4a to an 8a for my Mom, and it's around €160, plus she gets a nice store-credit that can be applied to future purchases.

If you time your purchases right, you frequently can get 50% to 70% off of MSRP. For a family of four, that is much better than buying dubious factory returns or grey imports. I time my upgrades around these promotions. Some years, the offers are sufficiently compelling and I upgrade; other years, nothing great comes up and I hold on to my device for one or two more years. It's simple math.
I've had cell phones since the mid 1990s. Since then, we have gone through quite a bunch of protocol and network upgrades, some of them incompatible with previous version (CDMA, GSM, GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, HSDPA, HSUPA, LTE, VoLTE, 5G, ...). Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't have been able to avoid upgrading every few years.

Also, we have been through at least 22 major (or minor) releases of Android. Most of them have lost support after a few years. It would not only be very insecure to use an old Android device, it most likely just wouldn't work. The app store enforces minimum API versions for security reasons, and these requirements keep updating every so often.

In other words, it gets really difficult to completely avoid upgrading, even if you didn't have to do so for reasons such as the battery failing. I find that after three years you are starting to feel pain points, and after five years, the shortcomings of the older devices becomes really apparent.

Things have gotten a little better in recent years, as innovation has naturally slowed down, but in the early days you often had to upgrade every year or two unless you wanted to suffer through lack of network coverage as providers kept phasing out older technology in rapid succession.

And once you realize that phones aren't buy-it-for-life items, you notice that the sweet spot is around 2 to 3 years, as by that point the trade-in value is still so high that you can minimize overall cost. You could opt for not trading in, but those older devices eventually become e-waste, as they won't talk to the cell providers nor to the Google (or I guess, Apple) servers.
Lol what

Wtf are you talking about? It's hilarious how quick people who don't want to move on will have a tantrum when they hear the truth and down vote.
This. Plus you wear out the usb-c port twice as fast. Plus you can't charge and listen to music.
Yeah having settings that don't do what they say is a big no thanks from me dawg. I've been using all my phones as a bedside clock for a decade without issue. I also found a bug with their 3 finger screenshot thing. You can turn it off (I have a couple multi touch apps that contend with that setting) and it still takes screenshots even when you set it to ""off"". Then after a reboot it will finally stop taking screenshots but just freeze and bug out the phone any time you touch the screen with more than 3 fingers. Like what? That is not acceptable at all.

Also and finally, I found the speakers incredibly lacking and kind of meh. I was excited but walked away bummed about the whole experience. I hope they fix their shit and get serious about things because I would love to have them as an option.
I'm sorry but I'm just a little bitter that I watched a dozen reviews about the OP13 and all I saw were people fawning all over it but in two days I found multiple bugs that at least deserve a mention. Like what are we doing here guys? Actually use the phone before the review. Check for known issues on previous generations and mention the issues if they are still present. I think most of these guys just watch a couple videos and fire up some Genshin and call it a day and go back to their iPhones. We deserve better reviewers man.
And now the SD card for 1TB costs about the same as 128gb 10 years ago. HAHA.
I'm talking about the fact that no matter where you put the dac, the end result will be the same. Feel free to explain where i'm wrong.
They must have fixed that screenshot bug, cause my 13R doesn't take screenshots when I turn off the setting.  I don't have the 13, I returned that for the 13R, so I can't comment on the speakers, but the ones in the 13R are fine.
Reviewers absolutely suck.  For example, they will compare a Pixel 9 Pro XL and the OnePlus 13, and they run a quick benchmark on each and call that a performance comparison.  How about you actually use each phone and their competing features and show us real life performance comparisons.  Take a photo of the same thing, compare the photos.  Delete an item out of the photo using the AI erase features and show how fast and accurate each one does it.  And on and on and on, there are so many things they could actually compare that people actually do in real life, but they don't.  Drives me nuts.  Its like the only thing they can possibly think to do is app launches and running a benchmark test.  Where are the damn reception tests????  Where are the edge case WiFi tests?
Ok now if you have an app with 3 or more finger multi touch (like a piano app etc) then try using 3 fingers the phone will bug out and go crazy. I promise that it's still there because it's been there since like the op11
https://imgur.com/a/w6odIbf

Works perfectly fine.  They must have fixed it.
Awesome. Hope they keep making progress.
I wish they had as good of a bug report system as Pixel's had, and/or a community representative on places like reddit to actually note down bugs so they could get them fixed fast.  I personally haven't run into any bugs that are dealbreakers for me and I absolutely love the OS, but they do need to fix these issues that people want fixed, and none of them seem that hard to address.",2025-01-27 16:44:32,111,106,https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-9a-pricing

GooglePixel,Google Pixel 9 Pro XL - different sounds for different apps.,"Hi all, this might sound like a no-brainer. I've just purchased my first Google phone a few days ago, a Pixel 9 Pro XL. 

It's been a great phone, but there is one thing that I can't figure out for the life of me - and that is making apps their native sounds. (Gmail sound, Shopify sounds etc) 

Currently the phone is giving me the same sound no matter what notification it is, which is frustrating as obviously I would love to know exactly what has notified me without having to unlock the phone every time. & yes, I've went through all the notification/sound settings. 

Is there a fix to this? I really don't want to believe that these sounds **can't** be changed as that's nearly a deal breaker for me. Thank you 

Comments:
Go to the notification settings and change the sound to your liking
App developers set the default tone for notifications. But you can customize it yourself. Unfortunately, Google made this a little more complicated than it should be a few years ago. You need to get into the app's notification settings and tap on the notification type with the toggle next to it. There should be an option to set the sound for it there. The options here can vary app by app though I think.
That's down to the app developer. Some apps will give you the option to specify a notification sound but most apps just use default sound.",2025-01-27 09:19:44,5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ib491x/google_pixel_9_pro_xl_different_sounds_for/

GooglePixel,(Question) Any apps similar to the native Gallery app on Samsung Galaxy?,"I just switched from a S10+ to a Pixel 9 Pro, loving it after installing a certain OS. My biggest gripe so far is that other than Google Photos, I don't have a native gallery app, nor does the one I've tried have a native simple photo/video editor built into it. I've installed Aves as the gallery app of choice and it works well enough, but it does not have any sort of in-app native editing software. On my S10+, its native gallery app has that ability and it makes doing simple resizing and cropping easy for both photos and video. Trying to edit anything on Aves gives you the message ""There are no apps that can handle this"". I've tried using other apps from various sources and either Aves still doesn't recognize them or they are simply only for images and I cannot use them to crop videos the same way as on the S10+. I've also tried using PowerDirector, but for some reason it doesn't seem to work as when I tried cropping a video, the end product was the exact same as before I cropped it, meaning it did nothing, meaning it doesn't work. Any suggestions are appreciated, thanks in advance.

GooglePixel,Pixel 9 pro and 9 pro Xl video zoom from 1.1x to 4.9x is out of focus and blurry,"Hi, I just noticed a irregular behavior today while recording a video from rear camera. I tried to zoom in the video to focus on the on the boat and when I went ahead from 1.1x up until 4.9x zoom,  the video was out of focus and blurry. When reached zoom to 5x, the video was instantly in focus. 

Has anyone observed this difference of out of focus zoom for Pixel 9 pro and Pixel 9 pro xl while recording the video from rear camera.

I have posted the you tube video link to help you understand what I'm talking about. Let me know if you notice it too.

Yeah its happening with me as well. Curious to know what others experiences are. And any solution to this? Just dont tell me to buy an iphone... Lol
I also have this issue
That's normal. iPhone also does the same:

[https://youtu.be/7Sn8nWLrTuE?t=23](https://youtu.be/7Sn8nWLrTuE?t=23)
Looks like the main camera is not focusing properly.

Did you try tap-to-focus on the boat before zooming?  Does it look like the video focuses on anything properly at all before digital zoom?

You can try clearing the cache on the camera app.  That has fixed misbehaviors in the past for me.  Can also uninstall updates from the play store and let the app update again in case there was a buggy update.  I haven't tried zooming into video recently on my 9 pro xl, in case it was an update issue.
Because until 4.9x it's digital zoom, at 5x it switches to the native 5x zoom lense.
Why doesn’t it combine the 5x zoom with 4.9x using AI? I always thought it was going to do that, and it’s really shitty that it doesn’t
Don't use those zoom magnifications then, use 2X and 5X like a normal person
buy an iphone
I tried multiple times to focus, it didn't work it was blurry at all times  until it reached 5x zoom. I have pixel 9 pro xl, I thought my phone is defective. I asked my friend who has pixel 9 pro to do the same test, he had blurry and out of focus zoom from 1.1x to 4.9x too and got clear when 5x zoom kicked in. Now, I'm relieved that it's not a defect on just my phone. It is pixel 9 pro series wide.
Sure, but if you look at OP's video in their post, the zoom in during the digital zoom portion looks different than the behavior of a digital zoom normally (at least based on my 9 pro xl)--the ship itself and the entire frame looks very out of focus starting at 1.1x and going all the way through to when the telephoto camera kicks in.
the edges would be fuzzy. if you take 4.1 for comparison than the edges would be even more ""inside"". I would not want an AI zoom enhance details on my edges :)",2025-01-27 04:04:36,19,11,https://youtu.be/-JNWd1o4Nyc?si=Z6cDVCo5Ye8tR9vF
GooglePixel,Pixel 9 series AI goodies on other languages,"Hello everyone!

Just ordered my Pixel 9 Pro XL and a loooong wait is expected :D

Until I get it, I'm wondering about usage of some of the new AI features (which sadly never made it to my 7 Pro). Mostly interested on Weather and Screenshots apps, but the rest would also be nice if they worked as I hope.

I have a pet peeve of having my phone's language to my main language (Greek).

As far as I have read around, most (if not all) of the new AI apps (like Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Studio) or apps which include new AI features (like Weather and Photos) only work in English and need to be sideloaded in the EU. I have no issues with sideloading from APKmirror, but an anyone let us know if the language barrier applies to the phone's system language, or the app language (like if set through per-app language settings)?

Essentially, would I be able to set -only- those apps to be in English from the per-app language from settings? Or does the whole device need to be set to English?

Thank you! :)

GooglePixel,Buggy Fingerprint Sensor,"I have a Pixel 9 Pro, and the fingerprint sensor has been super buggy off late.

Some times the fingerprint icon comes up but it does not react to my fingers at all. It's not that it's not recognizing my fingerprint. It's not working at all.

Then there are times when I open the camera from the lock screen by double clicking the power button. Then when I take photos, I get a message from the sensor to press down the finger firmly, even though I am clicking the shutter button.

Anyone else seeing this?

Just to confirm, have you tried the steps from this [article](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/13537318) to fix issues with your fingerprint sensor on your Pixel phone?

I have this exact issue(s). I believe it has to do face unlock which I also have enabled. It tries to use face unlock but is having trouble (due to poor lighting).  I can usually tell when the white led screen ring around the front camera lens goes off. 

I haven't tried it yet but I believe if I turned off face unlock, this would cease to be an issue.

GooglePixel,Is it worth spending on 45W adapter?,"I have recently started using Pixel 9 phone and am confused with regards to spending extra money for a 45W adapter of Google.. What are the disadvantages of using 30W over 45W in regards to below conditions:

2. Since the phone is new i stop the charging around 80-90%.
3. Charging time is not a concern for me. 1 hour is fine by me.
4. Would be using the phone for a longer duration. Any impact on battery?

Comments:
You're not stuck. Those are the most recent updates. What exactly do you think the updates are gonna do for you lol.
Security updates are not the same as google play updates.
I'm on November also, sometimes I've noticed I get a large update but the date doesn't change and I believe this is not uncommon with Google.
I am stuck on November as well and I am even on the 16 beta.
If I'm wrong someone will correct me but I believe security updates and patches come in the monthly system updates and I can't remember seeing any posts about any differences a play update made. My 8Pro got a January play update a week or so back, never seen a December update, my P6 and an old Moto both still on November.
My pixel 9 updated january 5th.
Pixel 7, happens to me almost monthly. The updates are pushed out throughout the month so one person might get it before another. Although it sometimes hangs and might take a while for the update to come through. I would suggest just sideloading the OTA. You can get the OTA image and the platform tools needed off of Google's android developer website. If you decide to go that route, make sure you go for the OTA and not the standard firmware update. Standard firmware update will wipe the data, OTA will not.
Doesn't seem to be the most recent. https://imgur.com/a/4MQiTwH

Google play updates are far less important than the monthly security ones.

GooglePixel,How do I simoly cooy a photo to the clipboard tonlater insert it into another app?,"I'm on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold and I'm struggling with one of the most basic things that worked like a charm on iOS. 

I can't figure out how to copy a photo from the photo app to the clipboard. Is there a way or is it not possible.

I also tried to drag a photo from the split view from the photo app into the email which also didn't work, even though the are on gmail for drag'n drop was highlightet.

Ye, I know, you can add photos directly from gmail but I have so many photos and without being able to filter them, I'll be scrolling for minutes. What's even worse it that the overlay to add photos siappears after tapping on a photo which makes me again scrolling for ages if i wanted to add more photos...

Comments:
Why aren't you using the Share menu to put your photo in the appropriate app?  Just select the photos you want, then select the share icon and choose gmail as the shared-to app.
screenshot the image? share option? create a folder for short term use & copy image there to find it quickly later?
If you half swipe up to get to the change app screen, it will also highlight pictures and text on the current app. You can then tap on the picture and you can copy that to your clipboard. Then you can switch to a different app and just paste it. That way you don't have to screenshot and bother deleting random screenshots later when you just wanted to share an image. This is also handy if you want to copy some text that isn't clickable on the app itself eg it's words on a picture and not a PDF (note this only works if the phone recognizes this is text, doesn't work 100% of the time)
I just read how someone cant figure out how to cut and paste in IOS. LOL. 

I was about to paste a screen shot of your post, but this sub doesn't allow image replies. So I can't prove you're doing something wrong.
Copy to clipboard?  Well designed apps that allow you to insert/attach images have a built-in function to do this.  All sources are usually listed so you can select where the images are stored, local, Google Photos, etc.  All the apps I use allow me to insert/attach images anytime before sending.  Good luck.
This only works when you insert your photos first. When I already wrote the email and then want to add photos it doesn't work as it's creating a new mail.
Yeah, eventually I did that. Does it take the full picture and not just a low quality screenshot?

Reading through the responses here makes me feel that a simple ""Copy"" from google photos isn't possible.
Yes! I also found out how to circumvent my problem: When adding photos to a mail on gmail, I now click ""attach"" instead of ""add photo"". With ""add photo"" you get an unfilterable overview of your gallery, however if you click ""attach"" you get more advanced options and from there you can open a filterable instance of ""google photos"".

Not good UX by google. The option ""add photos"" should default to a filterable photo search.
True. So now you know to add the photos and create an email first, then add the text later. Or just save the email you wrote as a draft, then copy and paste the text into the new email with the photos.
Sorry I am not sure about that. Usually I am using this feature just to share a quick photo to family or friends, so I am sending it through a chat which will compress it anyway. I find the quality good enough though. I particularly like the fact that it generally grabs just the image and not everything around like your phone UI.
Yep, that's a nice feature for quick chats but unfortunately not a good user experience if this is the only way to copy an image from the photo app.",2025-01-26 15:37:00,0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1iahjoz/how_do_i_simoly_cooy_a_photo_to_the_clipboard/

GooglePixel,Pixel 9 and Gemini perk?,"I recently bought Google Pixel 9, I keep reading about the Gemini advantage and people using it in the advertisements. 

Does it come in built for Pixel 9 users? Is it paid or the generic free version? 

Or is this a gimmick, im thinking if any android user can download the gemini app and start using the public free version, then what is the benefit in buying Pixel. 

Comments:
I have pix 7a and I downloaded the Gemini app asap, and at first it was shit, worse than the assistant. Now is definitely fine. I use nothing else and I use it all the time. In pix 9 it's default and comes with the phone.

Since this week multimodal features are there already and are awesome. All reviewers say all new features do work (search for this, format it in a list, send it to my friend through WhatsApp, all in one command) etc...

It may be a gimmick, but if you start using Gemini as your real assistant... It's starting to be really useful imho.
I have the 9xl and I like Gemini. The conversations you can have with it are legit like you're talking to someone. I use it for recipes and tons of other stuff. But for example if you ask it like ""how much concrete do I need for a 10x10 garage if I want the concrete 4 inches deep"" it will said ""ok so first we need to figure out xxx"" and I'll say ""just tell me the answer"" and it will say ""ok you'll need 8 yards""....like it's really interactive and easy to use.
Pixels have Gemini AI throughout the entire phone, not just on the Gemini app itself. Samsung is using Gemini to power their AI, but get features far later than Pixels. 

A Pixel feels like a new phone every couple months with rapid release of new software. That's one of the big advantages of Pixel. Also the smooth and polished UI. Samsung One UI is cluttered with multiple apps for everything.
Thank you.. so Pixel 9 users have this privilege, or any android user can make use of it for free?
>I use nothing else and I use it all the time. In pix 9 it's default and comes with the phone.


Can you give some examples of what you use it for and prompts?
But you could do this with any android phone with the free gemini, why only 9xl?
There are 3 versions of Gemini already that are live at the same time. 1.5 and 2, and then 'advanced': the subscription based which is extremely expensive imho. The first two, just open the Gemini app. Also you have Gemini live which is a side feature of all 3. It's the exact same for all android users... A little more seamless with pixel phones, and a lot more seamless in the pix 9 lineup.
I typically set alarms or add tasks to my to-do list. Occasionally, I use it to rewrite my posts for platforms like Reddit (like this one) or emails. My English isn't perfect, and this feature significantly improves my Communication.

Haven't yet explored the new multimodal capabilities myself. However, I've experimented with web data extraction: really good at tasks like generating lists of the best movies from a particular era or genre that include specific elements, so they are saved directly into a spreadsheet or sent to people through chat apps or message apps or Gmail, etc...

Furthermore,I did try it can summarize PDFS, videos, or audio files without requiring me to read or listen to them directly.
Not sure. I assume it's different in some aspects because of the built-in AI and the ability to run smoother with the processing.
So I could get any android phone, and use the same gemini, so how does having a Pixel 9 help? (Exploring the value prop.. not questioning you)
I am unable to differentiate the built in AI. Got the gemini app for a non pixel phone and it works exactly the same, and free too

GooglePixel,Pixel 9 Pro - Google Wallet Rant,"
Okay, I've had my Pixel 9 Pro for a couple of months now, and overall, I'm loving it. But can we talk about Google Wallet for a minute?
Way too often, I'll tap my phone on the terminal and...nothing.  Just sits there like a brick. This even happens when the phone is unlocked, which is supposed to work seamlessly.  It works maybe 85% of the time, but that other 15% is enough to make me carry my physical cards everywhere.
And then there's this weird ""multiple cards detected"" error I keep getting at certain stores.  I only have one card set as default, so I have no clue what's going on there.
Finally, why is Google Pay integration so spotty on websites and apps?  Apple Pay seems to be accepted everywhere, but I'm constantly having to pull out my physical card for online purchases.


Comments:
No problems for me, just face unlock and tap that's it
Hi, I recommend you to post or search for your question on the[ Google Wallet Help Community](https://support.google.com/wallet/community). Hope this helps.
""multiple cards detected"" if that's showing on the card reader or till, it's usually due to the person paying having a physical card in their phone case so the card reader picks up the phone and the physical card at the same time and complains.
Also it doesn't matter if ""apple pay is accepted everywhere"" they both use NFC, if a shop accepts apple pay then they will accept Google Pay.",2025-01-26 07:11:45,0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ia8dvy/pixel_9_pro_google_wallet_rant/
GooglePixel,Disappearing mobile data connection Pixel 9 Pro XL (Japan),"Hi,

recently purchased a Japanese Pixel 9 Pro XL and everything is working fine except occasionally disappearing mobile data connection.

When it happens, I see only the exclamation mark in the signal strength indicator (image in the link [https://imgur.com/1epV4Z1](https://imgur.com/1epV4Z1) ). Wifi connection is always fine, even during those episodes.

It doesn't fix by itself. Sometime it is enough to open the Internet tab from the pull-down menu and press on the mobile connection to fix it, but in most cases I need to reset the mobile settings (reset button with a wrench at the top right corner of the internet menu). After couple of presses/resets it is usually fixed. 

I couldn't notice any pattern for what triggers it so far. Usually (but not always) when I check the phone in the morning it's gone. Sometimes it happens during the day too, but I couldn't yet figure out for what reason.

It is a Japanese version and I am using a Japanese data-only physical sim card. I tested it on a different voice+data sim card and it happens as well.

Has anyone had the experience with that issue? Any fixes?

Comments:
I had something similar happen, data would go out constantly. What fixed it for me was clearing data on the carrier services app, you'll have to search for it in the app list in settings it might be called something else if your language is not set to English.
What carrier ? Can you go to settings, reset options and reset mobile network settings ? Check if that helps.

Sadly, those features are not in the default Photos app. That app is really focused on using Google's ""machine learning"" or ""AI"" optimizations. They work surprisingly well in most situations. The Pro mode allows you to do all sorts of manual adjustments but there is no way to set defaults, or save presets.

Open the Photos app Settings and fill out a Feedback report with your feedback ideas. 

While waiting for that to change (which it may not), you can check out third party camera apps. ProShot is often recommended. Search Play Store for ""camera app"".

The official Google cases are minimal cases. So drop protection is not really there. Just go with the Spigen clear case if you want your phone's colors to pop through. 

Personally I always skip the official case unless they start offering drop protection. Most of the time it's just a expensive minimal case for scratch/lip protection. 

I also tend to buy several cases from a range of manufacturers so I have something to swap out to for occasions or when I want a different aesthetic.

GooglePixel,Pixel issues as a new user,"
I've had my Pixel 9 for five days now, after being a Samsung galaxy series user for 10 years, and I'm really frustrated with several issues. First, I can't select multiple photos at once in the gallery by swiping my finger, which is a major inconvenience. Also, the microphone is inconsistent – sometimes it picks up my voice and other times it doesn't. Then there's the Assistant – it always searches for 'Jimmy Night' or opens the Gemini website when I want to use Gemini. Finally, my screen keeps locking while I'm using Gemini, especially when the screen timeout kicks in. It's really disruptive. I'm wondering if other users are having similar problems.
Gemini assisted in writing this post

Comments:
1. You can definitely select multiple photos with one finger in google photos. I Just did it on my pixel 8. Touch and hold the starting image you want and drag over to the right and down. 

2. Once and awhile I get this issue but it's because I start talking too fast before it kicks in. Try waiting a second before you speak. 

3. Change your screen time out duration. Go to settings, display & touch, increase from the default 30sec 

Hope some of this is helpful!

GooglePixel,Does the Pixel 9 Pro also have very bad audio recording quality?,"This was a very well known issue with the Pixel 7 Pro (and also the Pixel 8 Pro). You would record a video (or just audio) at a concert or other live music environment, it would sound great for the first 15 seconds and then after those 15 seconds some automatic mechanism would compress the crap out of the audio and it would suddenly become very bad and very quiet. I saw someone post that the issue was exactly the same with the Pixel 8 Pro.

Can people please confirm if they can record live music or live singing with good quality and without this sudden compression happening?

Android,Select to Speak is now useless,"I have happily used select to speak on Android for several years now, so it pains me to say that this tool is now almost useless on my Pixel 9 Pro. I'm dyslexic so this is a very important tool to have functional. 

The way it used to work is I would hit the accessibility shortcut, then drag a box or press play around content that I want read. It doesn't seem to be able to find text on ANY app. It is basically the ""No text found at that location"" tool. Even Gmail, which should be the place where the tool shines, does not work. Sometimes I get lucky in a browser, but it's something that I simply can't rely on anymore. Hell, I just tried it in Settings and it can't read the guide for StoS. 

I don't know what changed, but whatever it is it broke the tool almost everywhere. I have other reading apps, so if I want to read an article I can send text over there... But the convenience of Select to Speak is something I miss.

If anyone has a different experience, please let me know. If you know how to fix this, I'd be very interested. If you are a Google dev who works on this, please prioritize a fix.

Android,"Exclusive: Google Pixel 9a will come with Free YouTube Premium, Google One & More","

Comments:
I hate these ""x months free"" promotions for new accounts only. 

Not only does it focus solely on boosting subscriber numbers, they're banking on a large number of people signing up, then forgetting to cancel them. 

Sure, you can say that they should have cancelled, but for real
>According to our source, those purchasing the Google Pixel 9a will get [Fitbit Premium](https://www.fitbit.com/sg/fitbit-premium) for 6 months, [YouTube Premium for 3 months](https://www.androidheadlines.com/youtube-premium) and Google One 100GB for 3 months. This is similar to the freebies that Google offered for the rest of the Pixel 9 series, though interestingly Google is not including the 2TB + AI plan for Google One. So if you want to use all of the Gemini Advanced features, you’d need to pay for it yourself.

And someone correct me if I'm wrong, but if you're already using one of these services then I assuming the trials don't apply to you anyway?
Useless article, it's common for most new phones, you have to be a new subscriber and don't apply to existing subscribers. Nothing new.
They've been offering these free trials since forever
when I got whatever Nexus I was promised unlimited google photos upload. and I got it, except after a while it wasnt't that unlimited anymore
Wonder if this gets Gemini Nano at all with 8 GB ram, or it's behind experimental flag like the 8 
Can I just have a cheaper phone? I don't want any of that shit.
Pixel 7 to 9a a solid upgrade?
That's a bit fucking pointless then. You get a few months which in the grand scheme of things doesn't offer much of a value
Not free, just a three-month teaser.
Yeah, for 3 months.

Haven't they been doing this with every phone for the past 4+ years?
They would make more sales and gain more loyal customers if it was a permanent youtube premium service for buying this phones.  But.... theyre greedy.
So like literally every pixel? Where news?
I hope they offer a $200 trade-in for my Pixel 5. If so, I'm getting this guy.
Only for new accounts
See if they offered Yt premium for a year (on new and existing accs) and other features then sales would be through the roof
Yeah it's kind of annoying that all of these promotional deals companies do are aimed only for new subscribers. They don't typically offer benefits for those who have been with them for a long time.

That being said I do feel like YouTube premium warrants the price tag more than some other services. Having ad free YouTube and as free music is pretty sweet. Not to mention Google have occasionally sent some free things out to their subscribers over the years. I remember they sent free Nest hub speakers out years ago to people with accounts
exclusive! phone comes with a promotion for 1 month of blah blah. this should be labeled as spam
You can download Free YouTube Premium on any device
That's cute.

Hey G, we ain't falling for that shit again.
These trails are pointless. Samsung also gives a ton of free 3-6 month trails and I have never activated one of them.
TIL one can pay for YouTube and people pay for YouTube.
You guys are paying for youtube?
Lmao like anything will replace expandable memory, don't fall for the scam
Will Google One be optional or mandatory?
No point. It’s only for NEW USER.
>Google Pixel 9a is set to be the best sub-$500 smartphone, again

>As we also unveiled last week, the Google Pixel 9a will cost $499. Meaning that it is not getting a price increase this year, which is a really impressive price for what you’re getting. That includes a 6.28″ display, powered by the Tensor G4 processor, with 8GB of RAM. There’s also 128GB of storage, and a 256GB option (which will cost $599).

Wha???? There are already better phones for cheaper.
Just bring back unlimited Google Photos backups. Doesn't even have to be full quality.
Basically useless as it won't actually apply to many people, probably just those iPhone lifers trying Android for the first time. So I guess for Google why not, they'll spend essentially no money on this and it's good advertising/incentive. Sucks for the community though, and pisses people off, but what are we going to do not use Android lol.
Well...  *""According to our source, those purchasing the Google Pixel 9a will get* [*Fitbit Premium*](https://www.fitbit.com/sg/fitbit-premium) *for 6 months,* [*YouTube Premium for 3 months*](https://www.androidheadlines.com/youtube-premium) *and Google One 100GB for 3 months.""*

I wouldnt call that a deal really
March release basically confirms another early release for Pixel 10 whoop, can't wait honestly.
It's probably because they want you to be using their AI-enhanced phone so that they can track you even harder, and these loss-leaders will pay Google back multiple times over over the 7-year lifespan of the phone.
""Free Youtube Premium"" *\*guys cheering on couch meme\**

""...for 6 months with a new account"" *\*guys serious on couch meme\**
YT Premium, what do I need that for!? I have Brave as my default.
As  p9P owner I wouldn't mind having YT Premium as a perk either. Why does just 9a come with this??
[removed]
Reminds me Deliveroo offering me a 1 month trial of Deliveroo Plus. Every time I kept cancelling, I got 1 month more. I got 4 months total before they billed me, and then I cancelled. 

I bet a lot of people just forget about it because of how relatively cheap it is, must be easy to miss on a bank statement.
Sign of the times, sadly. No longer is long-term business rewarded. It pays to shop around — not just with phones but with anything really; energy, gas, new car, etc.

It's a shame, I agree, but the businesses ultimately profit off of your convenience by *not* moving and shopping around.
The annoying thing is that I didn't even get the 6 months Gemini promised with my s25 ultra.
Also to get people used to a lot of convenience and trying to convert free users to subscribe
It doesn't say anywhere it's new customers only, or is that how it's worked in the past? Never bought a pixel at retail lmao
yeah but the PM behind the idea can get a phat bonus so it's for the greater good.
It varies from service to service but it is pretty common that these promos are prorated forward to a ""next billing date."" Making them behave as if you pre-paid for x number of months.

So if you redeem, then immediately go cancel you'll stay active until the end of the promo cycle then naturally fall off as a customer.
It's to show investors that they acquired x amount of new customers during quarterly reports 


Modern day version of 'cooking the books' 
THere's a term for that in the business world that I forgotten
I didn't even read the article. I just came to the comments assuming that my dream of buying a Pixel 9a and getting YT Premium for like two years free was going to stay a dream. 

Imagine if they actually offered that on something, even to existing customers. I bet that phone would sell like hot cakes.
And a huge middle finger to the existing subscribers too. Existing users don't get a discount, nothing, you just lose the bonus entirely to punish you for already being a subscriber.

It's incredibly short-sighted.
agree, what about loyalty, members who are using products for years?
I do agree its bs in general but also honestly, its not that hard to subscribe and immediately cancel the subscription.

When money are involved people should always pay attention. The more they do, the less of these practices we would probaby see.
wtf am i going to do with 100gb for three months?
Most likely
Probably, and the deals never apply to family plans either, which is annoying.
Free trial basically
Correct, so it's scam marketing basically
And once you try it, you get locked in. If you use more storage with your free Google One, you then have to keep paying after the trial is over or you have to delete a bunch of stuff. 

Which I guess is the point, but I'm not falling for that. I've had two pixel watches and I never activated the free Fitbit premium trial on either one. Not worth it to me, even free.
I mean what the fuck will i do with 100gb for 3 months. Same for other things
Also it's just a few months...
Yep. iPhones get the same deal except with Apple services.
Nexis 5, nexus 6P my loves
I bought a Pixel 1 (2016) just for Google Photos unlimited storage. I'm uploading tens of gigs of photos and videos from my iPhone 16 Pro and my drone monthly for free, saving me hundreds of dollars a year.
And even then, it barely does anything on the 8 compared with what it does on the 9.
 Nope. They’ll keep adding stuff you didn’t ask for and charge you a premium for it. 😂
Wondering this myself!
No ads, includes music and about the same price at Spotify. I have it for the family and i don't understand why anyone would choose Spotify by itself over yt premium.
I share a family plan and I use YouTube more than any other streaming service, so for me the value proposition is there. The other streaming services I generally flip-flop between.
It includes Music, so yeah. After the last Spotify price increase, it was like $2/mo more to move to YouTube Premium. It's an even better deal if you do a family plan. And YTMusic includes a bunch of unlicensed music that's on YouTube, plus you can upload your own music.

I miss out on SponsorBlock, but I don't have to fuss around with third party apps, and I regularly watch on an iPad where that wouldn't even be an option.
This sub loves to rub their paying of youtube
Rule #10 on the sidebar. Read it.
SiriusXM is the same way, and after the additional free months, you get $1 months, $3, etc. lol
Those people must be clearly rich if they don't notice >$10-16 going out of their account every month or don't care to check.
I call this the ""Planet Fitness"" model. I always thought it was kinda smart how low their fee was years ago. I knew so many people that would get secondary memberships there because of the 24 hours and forget about them.
Was is supposed to be 6 months of premium? I just got an s25 ultra myself
You're not missing anything
Use the Google One app
I did, had to get the offer to trigger by installing and opening up the Google One app though.
Same, not very excited for these promos when I primarily get my phones by handing someone a wad of cash on a parking lot.
fill it up and then become a slave to google unless you want to lose 85% of your data
Use it as RAM 


/s
Bitches. They have the Asus Zenfone Go 5.0 from 2016 with free 100GB for 2 full years.
Temporary storage, I guess 🤷🏾‍♂️
I'm on the 2tb trial right now. Still have not broken 50GB lmfao. I basically only use Google drive for photo and document backups.
> If you use more storage with your free Google One, you then have to keep paying after the trial is over or you have to delete a bunch of stuff. 

How would you have this work? I'm not aware of any cloud provider that lets you keep using a monthly/yearly subscription after you stop paying.
Yeah
Yeah. I was generally talking about Android phones. For example, this is a common offer with most Samsung Galaxy, Google phones in the past. I was just implying that this isn't anything out of the ordinary and similar offers have been commonly offered in the past for new subscribers for a few months. At least in the US.
Is that due to hardware limitations on the Pixel 8? Or just software/product segmentation?
For me it would be for the organization of albums/artists and Playlist folders within folders. YouTube is a fucking mess when it comes to playlist organization.
Whoa...I didn't know there was a youtube music offering for a second I was confused until I searched for it.


I have subscribed to Spotify in the past, (not anymore though) and I've only ever seen or heard of spotify


I use a browser for youtube since I can bookmark videos to navigate to, so ads were always taken care of, haven't seen them since a decade.
True but premium doesn't have sponsorblock for example. I spent a lot of less time thanks for this. I reinstalled APK only once 1 year ago and still works great. Yes, i had to configure it but it takes max 10m and you are ready, for tv i will say it's 5-10m. In exchange i save 54 hours in last year.
So for me premium is loser. Better to spent some time on configuration even if u need 1 hour but save in one year a lot more


EDit: PS thanks for some downvotes. I guess true hurts people that pay for premium but ads are available even if u pay :)
Youtube isn't alone, Music and Spotify are also possible to get ;)
You don't lose the data, you just can't add anything new to the drive until you're under your new limit.
Whatever you store for the first 3 months doesn't count to your storage for the first 100GB. If you cancel you'd drop back down too 15GB, and anything new would count but the 3 months stuff would be nothing 


Otherwise it's not free, if you then have to pay to continue they just claim the money back and you don't save you lose, forever. 

They did it with Google photo storage, after the promo ended anything uploaded didn't count and anything afterwards did. Seems they already have a system in place to handle a feature like that to me.
Right, I was agreeing with you that it's something common that manufacturers do.
In the past Google, would give pixel certain plans for photos, then they remove it from future models. It’s pretty low imo
The Apple offers don't require you to be a new customer

Not that this is a great thing but at least it's a bit better
Google says hardware, but they also once said the Tensor was needed to make features like magic eraser work and then they introduced it to all Android phones, so who knows? The Tensor G4 isn't a massive leap over the G3 (most of the efficiency gains are because of the new modem and vapour chamber), and if apps like Pixel Screenshots wind up coming to the 8 series, we'll know their excuse was BS.
The 8 does have a hardware limitation with RAM. I assume the 8 Pro could run Nano with multimodality (this is what the 9 has) but they chose not to backport it
You also can't send or receive gmail. So you will have to delete. That's where the losing the data comes in.
They absolutely require you to be new customer, especially for the iCloud services and subscription related offers.
Thanks!
Thanks, makes sense.
They don't forcibly delete it on you though - You can download it and relocate it or something. It would be foolish to fill up a temporary storage limit and then let the plan expire with no plan to move the data.
Actually, no, you don't have to be a new customer. Over the years, I've been offered multiple times free trials of Apple Music and Apple TV+. Sometimes it's through shazam, sometimes it's after adding a gift card to my iCloud, sometimes it's after setting up a new device, etc
I’m a subscribed customer and over the years none of the offers worked for me as a paying subscriber
I believe you. But I was telling you about my personal experience. The one that I've received the most is Apple Music (3 times at least). And that included me being a paid subscriber and cancelling. And months later I was offered a new free 3 month trial",2025-02-04 16:56:39,296,104,https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9a-freebies
Android,Google Pixel 9 - A Long Term User Review - Hardware Canucks,"

Comments:
Currently in Germany the Pixel 9 Pro costs €1430 and the S25 Ultra costs €1450. Both for the 512GB models.

And the 1TB model of the S25 Ultra is €120 cheaper than the 1TB Pixel 9 Pro. What is Google thinking by not cutting prices?
God if the 9 pro had a Snapdragon 8 elite or Dimensity 9400 it would be better.

Tensor is a failure for the price point, the G4 is inefficient and although Google have improved compared to how terrible the g2 and G1 were in that regards it's laughable how bad it compares to Qualcomm and mediatek's offerings.  

In terms of daily performance I don't have issues with stutters or having the phone feel any slower to 9400 or 8 gen 3 flagships I've used but for $1000+ I still don't think that's an excuse when you pay that much money for a phone. 

Only reason I stick with pixels is because of how cheap I can get them considering I managed to go from a pixel 7 pro to 9 pro for only £100
the part where he is not happy with the response from old gemini model is like asking chatgpt 2 and being surprised its not updated on content beyond 2022, i mean the gemini 2.0 are very very capable models in every possible scenario. Assistant  / gemini mix is a problem but that will be solved with time.

Most consumers dont care about tensor g4 or games, and before anybody shouts about the price being too high, the fact is that the deals that google offers are incredibly competitive so the full price is never really paid. The phone is very good, no bloatware, quick, reliable, good looking.
Really weird seeing people defend Pixels performance so blindly. I have a Pixel 8 and I have weird stutters while scrolling in apps and I've factory reset it without restoring and all that jazz.

To me, the Pixel 8's SOC (and I assume the Pixel 9) simply isn't enough.

Weirdly enough, I never had issues with the modem or the battery life. (I'm in Europe, not sure if that makes a difference)
Relieved to see people still find ways to defend the small indie company for providing you with inferior hardware 3 years in a row.
very well done and honest review.
""long term""

The phone has only been out for 6 months FFS...
There's no point in reviewing it 3 years later after no longer being sold and out of warranty.
I can get a refurb pixel on best buy for less than $400 usd here in Canada, I am so sick and tired of my new iPhone 15 pro, at the same time I know the chip on pixel 9 is going to be weak power hungry and hot.
[deleted]
5 months is ""long term user""?

I'm on a Note 20 Ultra....that's the minimum for using ""long term""
The phone has been out a few months. There's no long term review.
Feels like a review made months ago tbh... I'm intrigued by the Pixel series but the reviews are so schizo that I'm going to have to fade.
2025 and questions around performance in a supposed flagship phone is odd. Why even bother.
Where he mentions that pixel camera app is buggy

Is it still not fixed. I have my pixel 5 and it works just fine.
If this phone is supposed to last for the seven years of software updates then a meaningful long term review should come 4-5 years in.
They call that long term?
I just missed a sale here in the UK on the MadeByGoggle website: Pixel 9 Pro 256gb down to £583.
Which was 20% off in their wintersale and £200 trade in boost on my s21fe on top of the £95 approx normal trade in.
So the deals are there but you have to be eagle eyed and vigilant about checking the website. I can't imagine theyll have another sale as good as that for many months though so gutted to have missed it.
I could have got the regular Pixel 9 256gb for £433 in the same sale! I was agonising about the processor and also adding financial burden now economies are poised to go into meltdown.
How did you manage 100 GBP?!

So you're saying all is buttery in the UI, regular apps usage (social, media and productivity (pdfs, docs)?

I see your point, I can get an S25 or a P9 for the exact same price (580 EUR) but the S25 comes with double the storage and a smart watch as gift. Still having 2nd thoughts about the P9, that camera is day and night difference.
It's really embarrassing to charge flagship prices for such a shitty (hardware wise) phone.
Im actually surprised with the new Samsung Galaxy’s out , Google hasn’t cut prices. The prices here in Europe have not moved which for a pixel is a big surprise
I'm not too fussed about the performance of the G4, but the inefficiency is what actually bugs me. This thing gets way warmer way faster than my old phone (S21 Ultra Exynos) doing very basic tasks. It's my one major gripe with it that it just gets noticeably warm in my hand doing next to nothing.
> Assistant / gemini mix is a problem but that will be solved with time.

Yeah... I don't think you understand how Google has ""worked"" for the past decade or so.
gemini v2 is leagues behind chatgpt o1 and even further behind o3.  I've been running Deepseek distilled on my home computer and it gives better results than gemini v2 for almost everything.
""In every possible scenario""

Lol, good one.
Reliable? Screen not auto-dimming (3:45 in the video) would drive me crazy. Google shouldn't be dropping the ball on basic functions like this in 2025.
Gemini can't search the web for data beyond 2022 ? 
that crap is useless.

i read somewhere perplexity released its own ai assistant for android and i believe they are able to search the recent internet, at least it's not stuck 3 years ago like google ai.
Except you forgot all the extra RAM they added and marketed to us we can't even use ..
yeah but the performance really garbage. were tallin 2 or 3 gen behind snapdragon or mediatek. my friend is a normie who understand a little about phone, but even he knew tensor is pure garbage for gaming
> Most consumers dont care about tensor g4 or games, and before anybody shouts about the price being too high, the fact is that the deals that google offers are incredibly competitive so the full price is never really paid. The phone is very good, no bloatware, quick, reliable, good looking.

yeah well the weak processor is still a ripoff, especially considering that 5 years from now it might perform like ass, while the equivalent Samsung will be fine with twice the performance. 

Google should just be more upfront and offer realistic pricing; the only way I can find good deals in Germany is through ebay, their official prices are almost perpetually absurd. Can't buy the phone straight from them, so dumb.
I think people are ""defending"" it because it's not happening to a lot of us. I've had many Pixel phones and I've never really had much in the way of strange stutters or scrolling issues. I run into a bug once in a while, but nothing a simple restart doesn't fix. 

Phones have barely evolved at all in like 8 generations, it's not an SoC problem. It doesn't require that much power for most users' average usage as as it is.
hey i have a pixel 7 and the little stutters stopped for me when i enabled ""force max refresh rate"" in the developer settings. not trying to say its not an issue that fixed that specific problem for me at least
Isn't the 8 hit specifically with that? 

https://www.zdnet.com/article/does-your-pixel-8-stutter-while-scrolling-google-has-good-and-bad-news/

That's when complaints seem to explode, my 7a is buttery smooth, apart from Reddit or Xitter where they run like you have a 2005 android. Instagram can be quite bad as well - I find it's always the media loading making it lag, but that doesn't happen on Boost for Reddit and never has.
The pixel 9 my brother has can’t even receive calls without them going straight to voicemail. Tried everything to fix it, turns out it’s pretty known issue. Pixels have always had weird issues. 

People turn a blind eye to them because they’re Google phones and “stock android”. 
Idk if it's ""blindly"". I mean, I have the 8 Pro and I don't have any issues with performance specifically. I don't use my phone for a lot of (if any) gaming. No stutters, no slowdowns, no nothing. I'm on a beta build right now, so I get the odd issue every once in a while, but that's on me.

I'm sure if I wanted to play Genshin (which I personally never would), or run the switch emulator (again, not for me), I'd rather want a SD800w.e. But screen calling and spam filtering is just waaaaaaay too good to ever live without. I don't care what the performance is, the features easily make up for it.
Because it's all anecdotal. I have a pixel 8 and have no weird lags or stutters. Bought on day of release. So to me, the pixel SoC is just fine. Never had to reset this phone. 

On the other hand, I have had issues with the modem if I keep 5g on auto and use the phone off wifi. It gets pretty warm and the battery dies fast.
Pixel fanboys have Stockholm syndrome out the wazoo. I’ve never seen such a fanatic, unhinged, unreasonable group on the internet.
Europe has more population density so I guess there are less remote areas to complain about the modem. Most of the complaints are in the US, Canada and Australia it seems.
Bought pixel 9 and returned it.  Camera was great… but the thing just stuttered and lagged and paused.  Couldn’t wait to put my sim back into my iPhone 12.  Came back from trip and went at 90mph to Best Buy, and returned the pixel (minus $45 restocking fee).  Will be just upgrading my iPhone 12 to latest iPhone now.  Pixel isn’t underpowered it’s just the software is coded shitty or they have some very low level bad coding for Android and those chips.
Owned a Pixel 6 for a year and Pixel 7 for 4 months. Never had performance issues, I could multitask and play games easily.

But they failed two crucial things that make a phone a phone, battery life and communication. 

The modem and battery life would vary day to day from below average to shit. They took consistently amazing pictures that my S23 Ultra still can't consistently do, but my Pixels had connection issue that led to deadzones which led to terrible battery life.

I live in a large metro area so lack of coverage isn't the issue which is why my S23 Ultra immediately had noticably better network stability once I switched.

I really want Pixels to get their shit together because I loved the Pixel experience and the amazing pictures but Tensor and other issues are holding me from going back.
Unless you're playing games it seems plenty snappy.

I came from a S20 FE 5G with a SD 865 and it seems way faster. 

I know comparing a ""flagship"" chip from 2024 to a mid range chip from 2019 is a weird comparison, but how much faster can an app launch? If it took 1.2 seconds to launch Chrome on my S20FE do I really care if it takes 0.8 seconds on the Pixel, but if it had a SD Elite 8 it would take 0.7 seconds? 

We're at the point with phones, like on the desktop, where it doesn't really matter what you buy - everything is sufficient (as long as you aren't gaming).
That's why I don't feel bad for them when their run into hardware issues. You are asking for it atp
I get where you're coming from, but if your phone isn't your primary gaming device, what does it matter? Should I give up my shitbox Thinkpad because my desktop has a 4080 and 7800x3d under the hood?

The phone works incredibly well. Its as smooth as an iPhone, the camera is on par with any other flagship and the battery lasts almost two whole days. If you find a use for a flagship snapdragon while browsing reddit, let me know. Sure the MSRP is high, but who's paying MSRP for these things?
Performance is important, but CPU speeds just don't matter like it did a decade ago
I mean hate me or disagree with me, but I feel like the Pixel phones are just like Windows phones back in the days : they run buttery smooth with less specs than other devices thanks to their well-managed OS
Yes but I think that's long enough for issues to arise.
I'd say that's pretty long term for a phone that gets refreshed yearly?
With reviews you have to give them the benefit of the doubt, these guys change hardware so often to stay current and make content it's long term in his books
Most reviews are based on people using phones for a couple of days to a week at most.
What do you want? A review 3 years after the release when no one will buy it anymore? 6 months is fine for a long term review, most YouTubers only carry a new phone for 2 weeks before reviewing it.
Need a real long term review on the 4a or 5
That's long enough for a review.
Look, surviving on Pixel phone for 6 months counts as 5 years :D
Also you shouldn't trust hardware Cunack's anyway. They are imo in hardware unboxed territory.
Pixel 9 bro.  Been out for about 5-6 months.
While I understand there is no point in doing for for most people.   
I would love to watch that to see what brands hold their promises better


How phones age is one of the biggest factors I consider before recommending or buying and till now only source I have is personal experiences of people I know
Why isn't there?

People still put out reviews of the iphone 13 series. Google proudly advertised a 7 year update policy so hypothetically someone could buy the 9 pro on the used market in 2027 and still get 4 more android upgrades
I'm so confused, I have an old pixel 6 pro and it is literally totally fine for say to day use and that's using the g1. If all you're doing is social media, pics, browsing which is what 99% of people do, you won't even feel the difference. Still a great experience.
Define ""anything demanding at all"". Tell us about your experience, otherwise it's just a clueless attempt at generalizing. (BTW its Tensor SoC not CPUs)
First of all I fucking hate all this AI bullshit being peddled by basically everybody in this space. And as if corporate-sponsored cryptobro copyright infringement isn't enough, companies are literally undoing years of emissions reductions by pivoting so hard on AI that electricity and water are increasingly diverted away from the masses *just to make that shitty OpenAI prompt finish a few milliseconds faster*.

Second of all I'm not buying a Samsung. Fuck them and their utter refusal to address their cameras' inability to take blur-free pictures while bending over themselves to copy Apple. The only thing *Ultra* about them now is the price.

p.s. the so-called ""height of cowardice"" is for zaxanrazor to brag how [downloading the ""camera assistant app in the galaxy store""](https://i.imgur.com/qOw26lf.jpeg) ""fixes"" Galaxy's infamously unresolved camera blur shitshow - and then exclaim with ZERO self-awareness [how anyone who disagrees with him is ""spreading Google propaganda""](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ifuboe/samsung_galaxy_s25_ultra_did_they_fixed_camera/majx69e/?context=3).
This is a stupid take. My Pixel 7 Pro is faster than ever. People on this sub thinks everyone edits 8K video on their phone or tries to emulate Windows on their phone. Guess what? Most people use their phones to use social media and take photos.
People get tired of people complaining how slow and unusable something is when it literally never impacts daily use.  Processing power is rarely the issue people struggle with in their phones in modern flagships.
My daily driver is a OnePlus 13 but I still have a Pixel 7 Pro I like to do comparison pictures with.  That P7P holds up just fine.  My issues with Pixel aren't with Tensor, its kind of with everything else but that processor is holding its own.  Google also extended support for a couple more years because Android isn't changing that much and the Tensor can handle it.
Demanding and Pixels don't go hand in hand. Why would anyone who bought a Pixel think they can do something demanding on it? Absurd point.
whats the point of reviewing an obsolete phone?
What do you mean by Schizo?
I think it's mostly the tensor based pixels. I know someone who's having similar issues on their 8 pro. Even though I have a 9 pro and I have no issues in the camera app.
Who's going to watch a Pixel 9 review in 2028, more importantly, who's buying it?

Your thought process makes sense but no youtuber is going to think it's worth doing.
Given how many issues are present currently, is it worth it?
Pixels become dirt cheap after a year or two
Yes general usage I have no slowdowns or any stutters , it felt no different to a Find X7 Ultra or Vivo  X200 pro to my eyes 

In terms of my £100 upgrade, £1000 base cost

30% Google Store code made it £700

£540 trade in for my pixel 7 pro = £160

Received a £70 Google store credit that I received signing up 2tb Google one plan which gives you 10% credit for Google store purchases. I used that credit to buy a Fitbit which I sold for £60. Bringing my total cost of upgrading from a pixel 7 pro to 9 pro for £100.

And I did a similar deal for the 7 pro which actually made me money going from a 6 pro to the 7
Where I live in EU, they're more expensive than the S25. Literally be real.
Yeah I had a s21 exynos that warmed up very easily, and shooting video it would get pretty uncomfortable, if the pixel's the same or worse, it would just make me not wanna use it for video.

Our opinions don't really matter, there are benchmarks that prove otherwise.
I meant coding, financial consultations, generic questions etc. At least that's my use.
No, google is not stuck 3 years ago, benchmark wise the big name llms are pretty much on par. Perplexity operates in a slightly different manner, if that works for you then great.
Idk it throttles less than my tab S10 ultra in balatro
Just having performance is garbage?
that is the beauty of it. You can go and buy samsung equivalent.  
But i have to say that i know plenty of people with 4-5 year old pixels that run great.
You shouldn’t defend it then if so many others are having the issue. It’s call survivorship bias. 

I’ve had 5 pixels, 3 had to be returned via rma, and the remaining two got worse over time with updates causing major issues including not being able to receive calls.
It is happening to you; you're just too blind to notice.
My biggest issue was delayed notifications due to aggressive doze. You won't find anything about it unless you go looking for it. And it's easy to confirm it's an issue because you can disable it with adb commands and notifications (mostly) come through instantly again. It even happens on *Gmail*.
Owned a Pixel 6 for a year and Pixel 7 for 4 months. Never had performance issues, I could multitask and play games easily.

But they failed two crucial things that make a phone a phone, battery life and communication. 

The modem and battery life would vary day to day from below average to shit. They took consistently amazing pictures that my S23 Ultra still can't consistently do, but my Pixels had connection issue that led to deadzones which led to terrible battery life.

I live in a large metro area so lack of coverage isn't the issue which is why my S23 Ultra immediately had noticably better network stability once I switched.

I really want Pixels to get their shit together because I loved the Pixel experience and the amazing pictures but Tensor and other issues are holding me from going back.
This happens to me a lot but i assumed it was call screening because it's always spam numbers.
lol that happens with my Pixel 8 as well
Not just the Pixel, my old Nexus 5 had the same problem.  It was because of this problem that I switched to iOS.
I have a pixel 7 and I had that issue before. It took me a week before I realized because someone asked me why my phone is off. I was in the middle of a job hunt and have no idea if I missed  calls from employers.
Try visiting the comments section of any YouTube video review on the One Plus 13 or Samsung S25 Ultra. Anything short of complete admiration for these phones is met with anger.

Truth is all these fanboys are unhinged.
You don't get around much do you?
I mean, its Geekbench score is lower than an iPhone 12. What a piece of shit for a processor...

It's definitely underpowered AND inefficient for what they are charging us.
Was it lagging in opening and closing apps? Did you notice apps took longer to ""be ready"" after you opened them (for example Youtube will stick on the loading screen a second or two more on slower devices)? 

I ordered an S25 and I am having 2nd thoughts about Pixel 9. I want that good camera, but I can't stand a slow/laggy or random behaviour on my phone. It's the only reason I am changing phones (1+ Nord 2) else I could probably go on with this one for 2 more years in terms of hardware.
Why all the butt hurt though?  🥴
Google totally destroyed Pixel 4A's long term usability after pushing an update that ""fixed faulty battery"". 

My backup 4A went from lasting a full day to 1 hour SOT is borderline criminal. I'm surprised it got so little attention since it can happen to other pixel phones too. Here's a [good article about the situation](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/google-pixel-4as-ruinous-battery-performance-update-is-a-bewildering-mess/).
I'm still on my Pixel 5 right now and works great lol
After 3 years of everyday use:

Pros: great camera, great size, good performance, still works after few falls

Cons: back was cracked, battery life is no good
I'm using my 4a, the battery nerf has got me looking for a replacement. Also not sure if it's also directly related to recent updates but my Bluetooth connectivity has taken a dump as well.
Same philosophy as dog years
I meant to respond to someone else who thought 6 months wasn't long enough.
i have a pixel 6 and it lags when i play literally any game. you can say some people don't play games on their phone but that's not the point, the complaint is that pixels cost the same as other flagships now while providing an soc much much worse
[deleted]
OP is probably an iPad kid that won't buy a phone if it can't play the latest CoD mobile game at 60 fps.

The venn diagram of apps that require high end performance and are usable on a phone touch screen is just two separate circles.

Give me a responsive display, strong battery life, and a great camera every day.
I fixed the camera issues on mine.

It really is the height of cowardice to reply to someone and then block them so not only can they not debate your point but also can't reply to anyone else in the chain.
How can using an expensive phone for many things be an absurb point?

Pixel 9 pro is a 1099€ phone. What do you buy such a expensive phone for? To look pretty? You get laptop like performance to browse reddit and send sms?

edit: Somethings I do with a powerfull and capable phone:

a. Use my luts and profiles to on the go develop my FF camera raws, waaay faster than my macbook process them, chilling in my pocket.  
b. Any kind of video postprocess, even simple angle adjustment or contrast or anything, orders of magnitude faster than a desktop.  
c. Dedicated home server.  
d. Web editor and on the go local web server.  
e. Phone for app development testing.  
f. Audio recorder and processor.  
g. Obsidian everything.  
h. Make and mantain collections.  
i. Duolingo xd.
People are using their phones for 4 years and often 7 years now. 

There would be interest in how well these devices hold up, maybe not to buy that specific device, but future products from the company.
You won't even be able to buy it by then..
> more importantly, who's buying it? 

People who want a phone at a reasonable price that still gets software updates ? I think one of the main advantages of the 7 year of software updates policy is that you'll be able to buy a second hand phone from 4 years ago, and still have up to date software.

Then it will be really useful to have reviews that tell you if the phone is still good or if you're better off buying a cheap low end one.
And here I sat thinking I got a good deal from Samsung. Any further advice on how I could replicate your deal now? Where did you get that 30% code?
It didn't seem like he was complaining that hard, he gave his one criticism of the phone and said everything else was good...
Like these? https://livebench.ai/#/
can gemini look for more recent data ?

if so then, why when he asks what is his most recent youtube channel's video, it says it's a video that was made 2 years ago ?
> S10

That phone is 6 years old, so I'd hope so

EDIT: Since I'm being downvoted, I just want to clarify he didn't have ***tab*** in this [before his edit](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/Android/comments/1ig1qs9/_/#comment-info).
when 1 is a number, is it better than 100?
There's no way to definitively prove this, but I would wager that the large majority of Pixel users do not experience this issues, and I'm absolutely certain that most people do not have to repeatedly RMA phones. You accuse me of survivorship bias, but you're the one who is taking your minority experience to everyone and applying it to everyone. 

Should these issues be addressed? Yes, absolutely. Are they so common that Pixels are a poor choice of phone? No, definitely not.
I've had nothing but pixels and Nexus phones before that and I haven't had to return a single one.
Why have you had so many, if you've had so many issues?...
That's not survivorship bias.
Yup, I'm sure me, a majority of tech reviewers, and millions of consumers are all completely blind to the huge, glaring problems our phones have. You're right buddy, you got me.
Not really, even my pixel 2 was very smooth. I've used iPhones before so I know how a smooth phone should look like. I'm very sensitive to frame rate changes and colour accuracy so I would have noticed. After all, these things drove me away from Samsung phones completely.
I thought that was a chinese phone issue, a google service delayed notification on a google pixel sounds horrific
I dealt with that issue on my Pixel 5a, 7, 8 Pro, and 9 Pro. It's unbelievable that Google can't get basic functionality to work properly. I ended up selling my 9 Pro and bought an iPhone 16 Pro and while there were definitely a lot of things I loved about the Pixel at least now I have confidence my phone works properly.
Nice to know Googles been ass at making phones with working basic features longer than just the pst year then I guess. At least my bro can suffer with others now lol
Absolutely this. 

Truth is, different people have different needs thus not every device will fit every person. 

I never really understood the fanboy mentality for any brand - the corporation doesn't care about your loyalty.

Personally I can't stand OneUI so I avoid Samsung devices. 
My last device was an Oppo Find X5 Pro and it was fantastic, I'd get another Oppo but the X8 Ultra isn't coming to the UK - I've now got a Motorola Razr 50 Ultra and it's also fantastic, I'd also get another Motorola. 

Point being, just get whatever works for your needs, right?
I did find it odd that my iPhone 12  from 2020 is butter smooth running the latest ios18.2, yet a brand new 2025 $1000 pixel is janky.  Android is fundamentally flawed.
lol.  I see what you meant then 👍🏼.
I have a 4a and there's exactly one game I've thrown at it that has any sort of FPS drops for me and it barely impacts my gameplay. Are people trying to play PC games on their phones or something?
I get it but again most don't and I think pixel has some great added features that make up the value. (Call screen for one is Worth it's weight in gold)
What games are you playing lol. I'm doing full GameCube emulation at different resolution scales without issue on mine.
Nothing, which is my point.
Share how'd you fixed it?
> I fixed the camera issues on mine...by going manual and using an app.

When you have to literally download an app and shoot manual/RAW to *not* get blurry pictures of people, youve already lost the plot.
A phone means different things for different people. People can like it for its UI, camera, lack of bloatware. Everything isn't about performance. For me these usecases exactly align with using a Pixel. It's snappy even after 3 years of usage.

What do you guys use your expensive phone for? Training LLMs?
>What do you buy such a expensive phone for? To look pretty? You get laptop like performance to browse reddit and send sms?

The vast majority of consumers do this lmao, or do you think everyone buying iPhones are video editors running home servers?  Come back to the real world.
buying a 4 year old phone is usually not a good idea. Buying a 6 month old phone makes a lot more sense.
Find me in the United States. I got it through the Google Play store through the reward system. You need to be a gold level member or above.
Exactly, that's the one. The 2.0 flash is in top 5 and will be more than sufficient for 99% of the users. The rest are free to use deepseek until anthropic and google update their models again. Its changing constantly, all of them are super good. having gemini for free for a year is a cost saving for me.
the models get updated all the time (all the companies do the same thing, not only google).
It's literally free for you to use Gemini and find out yourself, lol
Tab S10 ultra
Out of 5 people I know that own pixels, only 1 has not had issues. There is such a stigma here around it after the large failure of the Pixel 2 call issues here too.

  
But yes, as you don't know how many have failed or had issues, you can't really say much.
Nice! I guess that means not a single pixel had any issues then!

On a serious note, how many have you owned/ I upgraded every 2 years starting from the galaxy nexus, and my partner had the off years which resulted in us having every nexus/pixel available haha. We both gave up after the 5 as it was the worst phone we have ever had - meanwhile the 2XL was my favourite phone, although it did die.
It sure is

“Survivorship bias or survival bias is the logical error of concentrating on entities that passed a selection process while overlooking those that did not”

Common mistake of “it worked for me”
Yes, actually. Tech reviewers barely use the phones they review, and the average phone user buys a phone for taking photos and browsing Facebook, so they don't pay attention to this stuff.
It's been going on for *years* with the Pixel phones. Google's own flagship phone running their own software.
Its all-individual experiences. My wife's iPhone 13 Pro is starting to behave erratically, and I have the Pixel 9 myself and have not had a single issue.
[deleted]
Yeah I love everything about my S23 Ultra but these Samsung fanboys are unwilling to live with the reality that having to use the goodlock camera app, change all these settings and still not consistently be able to capture motion the way Pixels or iPhones can is frankly ridiculous for the price we pay.

The goodlock camera app and setting changes does not fucking fix it, It only minimizes the issue and better yet these Band-Aid fixes come with their own drawbacks to picture quality
It’s crazy to me how many people clearly don’t see the issues with Samsung cameras. It cannot take a picture of a moving subject.
Yeah, fair. I really dislike the feeling that phones are basically GAS. We have had bright OLED barely any borders, amazing cameras, better than laptop performance and awesome constructions phones for more than 5 years now. 

There's no reason to get a phone anymore if you have no reason to use it differently. Its either GAS of FOMO.
I mean, everyone takes video, and nowadays everyone posts video. I bet you that your avg insta influencer spends more time videoediting on their phone than the youtuber you're thinking about does in davinci or whatever.

Also ""The vas majority of consumers"" can absolutely and should absolutely buy a $200 phone and be soooo happy. I do all that stuff and my phone is 250.

edit: All the things in the list are a click of an app that my turtoise can do. Dont think in green scrolling terminals.
haha, I got mine the same way. I found the instructions on hotukdeals and couldn't bloody believe it worked. I went from a Samsung S23 to a Pixel 9 Pro for like £45.

That said, I hate this phone. It's the first pixel I've tried and I cannot wait to go back to Samsung. Everything about it just sucks. From the quick settings, to the handling of dual sims, to the AI, to the size, to the lack of a proper Gallery app, to the stupid 'tray' bug when using a 3rd party launcher... I swear I have 10x the number of annoying bugs than I did on Samsung.

Goodbye Pixel. See you again literally never.
Also keep in mind it took Gemini a very long time to roll out 2.0 flash to end users.  They announced it back in November and it was staged over the last 3 months.
then why it couldn't find his most recent video and instead give a 2 year old video ?

I can't believe that gemini is so bad it couldn't find that. Surely google ai has access to youtube.
Ohhhhh, well that makes more sense now haha.
samsung always oc their soc, but i also have tab s9 fe, yet it didnt throttle
Your anecdotes about people with issues don't mean anything, nor do mine about people without issues. I do believe, however, that if these issues were so widespread that they were truly noteworthy then the Pixels wouldn't generally review well year over year (exceptions apply) and their sales wouldn't be consistently increasing either.
I'm not saying that every pixel phone has been perfect, but that I've had basically the opposite experience you have. 

I moved from an iPhone 3g to a Nexus 1, Nexus S, Nexus 4, Moto X, pixel 1, pixel 4, and current phone is a pixel 6 pro. Receiving a pixel 9 pro xl this week.
You're both operating on the same selection method. Whatever bias you claim, you're both guilty of it.
I've had the 6 Pro all the way to 9 Pro and never experienced this on any phone.
Are you me? I just triggered a trade-in promotion for an iPhone 16 Pro because the hand-me down iPhone 13 Pro I gave her started having camera issues and the battery was depleting faster than expected.

Meanwhile she still takes me Pixel 9 Pro for photo shots :(
That Pixel 9 Pro has been a big improvement on battery life to the 8 Pro, and I bet it's only due to the modem improvement.
okay, but their point is that 99% of people will not need more performance, and your original comment comes off as hyperbolic since it applies to a very small niche.
People get very defensive when you bring that up. I love when people are like ""it can handle motion, you just need to use pro mode, or record an 8k video and take a still from that, use burst photos"" but other brands you can just open the camera, snap a picture and it'll be clear.
That bad? Does photo quality make up for it?
Wasn't that literally answered in the top comments?

>the part where he is not happy with the response from old gemini model is like asking chatgpt 2 and being surprised its not updated on content beyond 2022, i mean the gemini 2.0 are very very capable models in every possible scenario

I asked for LTT and it pulled one from 9 days ago, so it doesn't seem fully up to date, plus I didn't specify which channel - it pulled a WAN show one 

Asked again being more specific and it got one from 7 days ago. Not perfect, but not two years old.
Marketing is a beautiful thing hey. Apple markets BS and sells more and more.

I remember reading through the lists of issues each new pixel had before I bought it...https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-3-pixel-3-xl-issues-problems-help-list/

""The Pixel 2 XL had a notoriously poor display that was infamous for quick burn-in and bland colors. The Pixel 3 lineup was plagued by bad RAM management. The Pixel 4 was a great phone held back by abysmal battery life. With every Pixel release, it seems like something rears its ugly head that keeps the phones from achieving true greatness."" https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-7-problems-cant-recommend-why/#dt-heading-the-pixel-7-is-a-phone-with-unresolved-problems

https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-experience-unreliable-inconsistent-editorial/
Nexus phones were great back in the day, they were cheap, average hardware but were great phones. Pixels just kept the same quality, but charged way more. It's funny as Pixel phones actually pushed my partner to hate android and try iOS!

At work we maintain around 48 mobile phones, of them we had all of them Pixels since Pixel 5, now 32 are iphones, 16 are Samsungs. We had the most RMA's to deal with in regards to Pixels than any other phone we ever rolled out. Mind you, my personal experience was mostly great with Nexus/Pixel.
I did not? I simply said they should acknowledge that there were many reported issues with the phones. I never said every single device is broken?

  
""I think people are ""defending"" it because it's not happening to a lot of us. "" - the comment I replied to.
You absolutely experience this issue unless your phone never enters Doze. The issue is by design, albeit a shitty design.
Congrats? The problem is well documented and has been for years, if you've never had a delayed notification (or perhaps never knew a notification was delayed?) then consider yourself lucky.
A very small niche at gonna spend that much money on a phone so it should do everything well and be good for a few years.
If photo quality is the only thing you're looking for, it's better to just buy a fuji/canon/sony/ricoh point and shoot camera.
You have nostalgia glasses or some other shit, there were an insane amount of issues with later Nexus phones.
And they never said every single device works. They simply said that the devices work for a majority of people.
You can literally Google any phone and ""delayed notifications"" and find a bunch of people complaining.
People are not buying these phones outside of carrier deals unless they're insane, and for most it will be good for a few years. If you're a GaMeR then get a ROG phone or some shit
Hahaha probably. Nexus 4 and 6p were really enjoyable and cheap phones though. The pixel was the first phone I bought that was crazy expensive
If you think that logic is sound, then you also agree that for the majority of people, the devices do not work.
Then Google should fix it, no?
I agree that for a number of people, the devices have the issues you've described.

And a number of people don't have issues with them.

You're both sharing anecdotes at each other, so I don't know why your anecdotes evidently carry more weight, and theirs is bias.
Ugh, so you are saying, that if I say the majority of people are having issues with it, that it has nothing to do with bias? I'm confused as you seem to think it is bias, yet you are saying I shouldn't say it is bias?",2025-02-02 17:00:16,205,180,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8Xr1hB5SBA
Android,Starlink satellite messaging support is rolling out to the Pixel 9,"Looks like T-Mobile and Starlink are starting to let some Pixel 9 users into the satellite messaging beta.

Just heard from two Pixel 9 Pro XL users that they were invited to the beta. 

When the beta first launched two weeks ago, [it was reported](https://www.pcmag.com/news/t-mobile-begins-cellular-starlink-beta-but-it-only-works-on-these-samsung) that only 5 Samsung models were supported (Z Flip 6, Z Fold 6, S24 series). My OnePlus 13 wasn't accepted into the beta, but hopefully that'll change soon.

FWIW: Google has been testing Starlink support on the Pixel 9 for a few months now.

Comments:
I got a text from T-Mobile today. 

T-Mobile: Great news! You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. Make sure your phone’s software is updated to the latest version. Questions? Please visit t-mo.co/satellite01
So Pixel 9 devices have dedicated satellite connectivity support, but T-Mobile is testing to do the same thing via a regular in-device 5G antennas? 

I wonder what it means for probability to get at least SOS satellite messaging for users in Europe. I am afraid this might even lower the chances...
I got the Pixel 9 emergency satellite SMS in Canada, but it only lets me message 911.

Can't wait for this to roll out to Canada in 5 years lol.
Won’t be using that thanks Elon
Yep, same here
Man. I wanted to try it out. I enrolled but it looks like no dice.
Does the phone already have the hardware?
T-Mobile is a German company 
Yeah, Starlink is the absolute last company I want to have my data in any form
Same. Looks like they want the latest generation of phones. Curious what the latest radios have added. Didn't know there was any new bands in 5G added over the last few years.
Yeah. Its satellite connectivity ready. 

""Satellite SOS works on the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL and 9 Pro Fold. It won't work on older Pixels because the 9 series has a modem with the ability to send messages back and forth to a satellite. Google partnered with a couple of companies to make Satellite SOS work.""
Well TMobile has indicated this will be rolling out to most users. It's using standard 5G antennas and to the user will just present as extra TMobile coverage. 

Users won't have much say in that. I guess you can spite TMobile by switching to a carrier without satellite service. Or use an iPhone with its free carrier independent globalstar powered full iMessage and SMS service
Yep starlink takes the cake between meta and google
""Satellite SOS works on the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL and 9 Pro Fold. It won't work on older Pixels because the 9 series has a modem with the ability to send messages back and forth to a satellite. Google partnered with a couple of companies to make Satellite SOS work. ""
can it handle data in future or only messages?
Nope, this isn't that. That's using Skylo which uses Viasat, Terrestar, and Ligado satellites. iPhones similarly use Globalstar for their satellite texting. 

This is direct LTE service. Starlink satellites are effectively operating as LTE towers in space.

Theoretically they should be compatible with any phone with the LTE band. That's why I'm wondering why they're limiting it to newer phones for now. Either it's a QoS thing during Beta or they need compatibility with a different communication standard that the newer radios have.",2025-01-30 19:23:20,64,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1idv2ua/starlink_satellite_messaging_support_is_rolling/
Android,Exclusive: Google Pixel 9a Exact Release Date Finally Revealed - It's Coming Soon!,"

Comments:
Largest battery EVER on a pixel. 

The 5a 5G's battery life was a fucking banger back then. So I can't imagine what this one is like.
>According to a source, Google will start pre-orders for Pixel 9a on March 19. The devices will begin to ship on March 26. Pixel 9a will also be available in-store starting on March 26.
Size wise, how will this compare to a S25?
5100 mAh seems average these days but from the 4492 mAh of the pixel 8a it's a big upgrade.
Older modem. For some, will be a dealbreaker, especially since in the 9/Pro/XL it's said to be noticeably improved. https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9a-modem-3477459/
It still frustrates me that this is considered a ""small phone""

>Google is sticking with a 6.28-inch display, so it’ll still be a pretty small phone.
The camera bar being gone and the whole back being more or less flush is the nicest change to me.
It should have been $499 with 256GB.
Not interested in the phone personally but those wallpapers are great. 
After the 4a fiasco where they made it obsolete by a software update, they can go and fuck themselves. Not getting another pixel.
The image makes Pixel 9a look like S25 Ultra. No way a $500 google phone will look that good.
Of course it is. Android 16 is coming early this year so the 10 series is too. 9a has to come out before all that.
Shit. I just bought a used Pixel 9 for like $510... I bought it because I specifically needed a Pixel, and good battery life. The 9 was my only real option. 

Do yall think a *new* 9a would have even better battery life?
 Hell yeah!!! This is exactly what I want from my first pixel phone experience lol my last android was a galaxy s20 FE and the 9a having a 6.28 screen size is perfect plus that battery is gonna be great. I’m genuinely pumped for this.
Does anyone know if this will have satellite SOS?
Is there no front facing cam either?
No expandable memory or headphone jack? Trash
5100mah in 6.28"" phone is crazy good. Just slightly smaller battery than Xiaomi 15. Even Google is putting Samsung to shame with their S25 4000mah. 


I like Samsung S25 because it is slightly smaller and easier to hold than Xiaomi 15/Pixel 9A but they are really shameless by not upgrading battery capacity at all.
Competing with iPhone SE 4th gen I'd bet
Thanks Mishaal!
Pixel 9A is probably same size as  Pixel 8A and 9 but it is slightly larger than S25. 


https://phonesized.com/compare/#2640,2463,2534
Hotspot3d will probably update the site with the 9a in a few days I assume.
Slightly taller and wider (by mms)
Meanwhile S25
Not average for a 6.3"" phone
It is even crazier with a larger battery than the S25 Ultra.
If it's the P8P modem, it's stir fried shit. My P5 worked great everywhere in my house. This P8P is just plain lousy. Really really lousy.
Nobody bought the Zenfones, despite them being small *and* having headphone jacks. Consumers, and even the Redditors gushing over those features found some other deal breaker with them.

No other company will ever release a proper small phone.
Yeah. Remember the Nexus 6 with a HUGE ENOUlRMOUS 5.96 something screen?
And here's me totally unable to find a decent 6.9 or 7 inch phone, The closest seems to have been the Mate 20X years ago but that suffered from not being blessed by Google.

Despite it's lesser screen I really want a modern version of the Xperia Z Ultra, that chassis with a modern screen percentage would be ideal, I _loved_ my Z Ultra

I look around and I see nothing but small phones coming out.
We live in crazy town where <¼"" smaller than a Nexus 7 tablet is now considered a ""small"" phone.
It's funny, because I got a 8a last year specifically because it was one of, if not the smallest phone on the market I could find. 

I still miss my iPhone 5c.
I still want a fingerprint reader back there though.
Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel look more and more like iPhone while iPhone looks more Pixel and Pixel.
The must have run out glue sometime during the pixel 9 rollout
It's a five year old phone that had issues with the batteries bulging. They're offering free battery replacements or store credit. What do you want them to do? Just leave it and risk a bunch of battery fires?
The image is the most generic render ever generically rendered in history
Their render doesn't seem to have a front facing camera. But I assume that's just a mistake.
2015 called.  They want their opinion back.
Man, give it up.
Headphone jack?
Not to mention still only having 25w charging. I've been looking to replace my s23 but the s25 really isn't worth the minor upgrades.
Would it be a upgrade going to s25 from 14 pro? I am hating the weight these days and my friend’s s23 left really nice to hold and use.. 

I might feel the difference in performance.. I am saying this as I noticed some lag even while unlocking and going to Home Screen or even as simple as opening a dialer.. but I am getting a sweet exchange deal, so thinking about it
Based on what I recall all modems in the 6-8 series are the same and that's what they're using. I'm fortunate I spend pretty much all my time in a strong signal area so not an issue for me but all new Pixel models should have the better modems at this point. The 10 will supposedly have a Mediatek which raises more questions.
The camera was shocking. Like, I didn't get a single usable photo out of it when I owned it.

When we said we wanted a small phone, we didn't mean ""and nothing else matters"".
The Zenfone failed for other reasons not related to its size. Shitty camera, and only two years' worth of support to name a couple.
Zenfone although have 5.9"" screen is actually as large as S22-25 because of thicker bezels. This phone is just slightly larger than those Zenfones.
It's only 0.5mm shorter and 2.5mm narrower than the Galaxy S24 but 1.8mm thicker. So not much smaller and has 0.28 cm² less screen area. It’s hardly a compact phone and falls short in other areas as well.
Camera was trash on that zenfone. I tried one for about a month.
Also Apple, with the iPhone Mini lineup. Small phones are a niche market, and it seems like many people who want small phones are more willing to compromise on that size than on other stuff like software updates or cameras.
I would've bought a Zenfone but the software sucked and they killed bootloader unlocking which sealed me never buying once because I don't trust them to keep it usable. Had nothing to do with the hardware, not considering any Zenfone for those reasons
I mean, the truth is the Zenfone is only a hair bit smaller than the base s22/3/4 and iPhone, it just had larger bezels so everyone said it was so small because the screen size was like 5.8 while the rest are 6.1, 6.2.
That headphone jack was worthless. Size was great, though. Too bad it was an Asus, with their garbage software update cadence and terrible after sale support.

I still have but rarely use a Zenfone 8.
Nobody bought it because of the software support. You will get a phone that will be outdated 2y later... If I could have an other option than samsung and apple for a 6in phone with a long software support, it would be really fun.
Yep. Now watch all the delusional redditers here thinking they're correct reply back thinking people actually want small phones
The cameras were bad and it's bezels made it around s23/s24 size and also weighting more since it's thicker   

Bigger point is it's pricing and deductibles on it weren't at all good, pretty much can find an s23/s24 since they prices do dip on top of good offers after 1-2 month  

Only thing it got going for it is the headphone jack
I don't need a ""proper small phone"", just something good enough to play audio media, check email, and can run modern Android apps. I don't play games on my phone, so I don't need a high end processor or a ton of RAM.

I'm probably just going to wait until Motorola puts the 2024 razr on sale for $500 or less because I like my Razr 5g and it's lasted me 3 years without any real problems.
That phone failed because it fucking sucked; not because of it's small size.
I'd blame the ZenFone failures more on a lack of proper advertising TBH.
Honor magic 5 Pro 6/7? Xiaomi 14 ultra?
Didn't the Galaxy S25 Ultra just release with a 6.9"" screen?
Aspect ratio (and bezel size) matters.

My Nexus 6 had a ""smaller"" 6-inch display than my 9 pro xl despite my nexus 6 being virtually unmanageable as a one-handed device while I have no issues with my 9 pro xl.
Nexus 7 had huge bezels that made it at least an inch or two larger than a current 7"" phone.
Would be nice if it was matte too
All the camera visors fell off.
Battery replacements are not an option in all locations. The store credit is also very low considering that the phone is unusable after the update and 100 bucks is not giving you an equal phone replacement. Many people that bought the 4a in the first place are not people that will buy a new Pixel for 3 times the price.

I understand that they can't risk a hit to their reputation if there is a defective batch of batteries but they are dealing with it in a way that is giving them bad publicity anyway.
The render also looks to move the volume rocker and power button, given the sizings...  I wonder if it's possible they're just straight up mistaking a render of some Samsung device for the the 9a.

Which is really funny since there are many rumors that the Samsung Galaxy A56 will have 45W charging.
s25 is lighter than s23
Wth why use mediatek, I would think as their 10th phone they'll put a good stuff in it.. I'm looking forward to upgrade this year... Apparently not..
Furthermore, the ""small"" Zenfones were basically the same size as the Samsung S2x phones or the normal-sized iPhones, which are consistently year-after-year the two most popular flagships. The size wasn't what made it unpopular--the market clearly shows that that size of phone is very popular. You can't conclude that the size was the reason the Zenfones failed.
Yeah Zenphones has a few issues. Support for the avg customer being only two years was fine, the cameras were total ass. Unfortunately, every phone manufacturer that has made small phones failed to make it successful. Apple being a prime example. Small phones are also in most cases more expensive to make, which makes it almost impossible to sell them cheaper without enduring sacrifices.
Network support too
""That headphone jack was worthless.""
Please explain.
For 6.1"" yeah the market wants them

The base s23/s24 have about [double the sale](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_sees_increase_in_galaxy_s24_sales_foldables_decline-news-65949.php) of the plus
I know not a lot of people want a small phone, but I know I do. That's why I bought a Razr.
**Small phones are bad for eye sight.** ^(Speaking from my own experience of using them. So,)

—**NOT** sent from my Mi 6 with its 5.15"" portrait screen *(or my previous phone, S4 Mini, with its 4.3"" portrait screen),* but, from my laptop with its 15.6"" landscape screen.
Zenfone 9 suits the bill for what you're looking for. If you can handle not having official support for much longer.
Xiaomi 14 ultra is  6.73""

Google pay/Safetynet is a requirement nowadays, most days I don't have or need my wallet, so all of Huawei is out.
Yep, That's pretty much the only well supported brand and I've sworn off Samsung since I had the S8+ (And Samsung stripped critical features from it in a software update) , that's one of the 2 in the last couple of years
And a very different aspect ratio...
It's a phone that's hit EOL. These are phones that are available new for well under $200 now in places that you can still find them (about $175 in Ukraine). What are you expecting them to do? Offer full refunds for phones that people haven been consistently using for half a decade? It was a $400 phone. That's under $100/year right there. I consider myself to be pretty pro-consumer, and I think you're being ridiculous. If you take the store credit and send in your old Pixel 4a for a trade-in you can get a pixel 8A for like $350. That's less than you would have paid for the 4a most likely. You aren't getting ripped off here.
I think it's not really meant to be the pixel9a and is rather just a generic header image.
What are you gonna buy?
Yeah you will lol. You'll die alone and unable to talk to anyone with your galaxy s2.
Both A36 and A56.
The Mediatek modems' and SoCs' rep has improved but we really can't know anything until it's reviewed and used by real people. It would be a humongous unforced error by G to screw the phone up that much after switching SoC production to TSMC.
The iPhone SE was extremely popular, wym? People have been begging for another SE for years since the mini replaced it and then was killed. Should be coming backing back this year though. 

Apple does the small cheap phone right — specs of the current phone with the tooling of the previous phone.
The DAC just isn't good. Like if you're going to plug in some cheap earbuds, sure, it's fine. But isn't the whole reason for a headphone jack these days because you want to use some nice IEMs or headphones?

Same with the Xperia series. I think Darko Audio did an episode on the Xperia 1 V's (maybe?) headphone jack. Wasn't good.
lol they're not bad for eyesight, they're bad if you have bad eyesight
ZF9 hasn't had support for a while, the 10 might still be getting security patches though
His only option is a Sony xperia 1 (whatever [mark][Roman numerals] revision is the latest), because he said that Motorola uses craptastic displays on their phones that have both 3.5mm and microSD

...which is why he's always so offended whenever a new flagship is released without both 3.5mm and microSD.
Sony Experia 1 IV is serving me well right now, and I will never buy a phone without expandable memory at the very least, ideally also a headphone jack.

Photos and videos are bigger than ever, why the fuck are people just buying phones that don't have expandable memory and used to? These simps out here ruin everything. Might as well buy an iPhone if the only difference is software.
Moto G64 launched last year. Moto G Power 2024 also.

The SE was kind of popular (not extremely) but it also just had shit specs not modern specs. Rear Camera was ass, front camera was ass, display was ass, no FaceID, huge ugly bezels, and the old ugly design. This phone sold because of the price and that's it. Not the specs.

That isn't what Apple does lol. The SE never had the specs of the current phone. What? Closest thing to this was the iPhone 12/13 mini. Except the camera setup. These actually had modern specs in a tiny body and relative to their reach, didn't sell at all. And the iPhone SE has like one spike year where it sold strictly because it was cheap, not good, and that's it. Smaller phones with actual modern specs are more expensive than larger phones and will never be cheaper. But, customers won't ever understand that.
Hmm. So are/were there any mainstream phones that have/had a headphone jack that's worthy?
I am truly sorry,

but,

I'm disgusted by how unintelligent that statement is.

*^(Ew.)*
Congratulations on saying exactly why sd cards will never, ever come back.
My local, physical storage will expand faster than I'll be able to fill it. And I take a lot of pictures. I also have an og pixel to deal with my cloud storage problem. Having an sd card to store photos just means I have a single point of failure for my art and memories. As is, I have them locally on my phone, in the cloud, and a regular takeout copy on an external drive.
> Next time you're deleting apps/photos/videos to get more space

...because I'm always moving them to more permanent storage e.g. *not* on a phone, genius.

> or paying Google a monthly fee for cloud storage

Hilarious. I've never paid for any cloud storage on *all* platforms.

> You'll act like you don't care

I really don't - even when I used a phone with *both* 3.5mm and microSD - so feel free to blow an engine gasket.

The irony of saying this while crying like a little bitch on this post is hilarious.
My images and videos come to about 10GB and that's unsorted for the most part, I could add them 8x over to my phone and still have a bit of space left with my 128GB device. I have never in my life needed to delete apps to clear space. 

A picture is a few mbs, you can store thousands and thousands before you need to even worry about space. The bulk of that 10GB is cat videos, take them out or reduce them to 1080p and it'll shred that size instantly 

We don't all need 5 million terabytes all the time, why is that so hard to understand. I've never seen something as dumb as the goddamn storage war, everyone's needs are different. 

You know I found an SD card in a bakery once, full of images of a family, wedding pictures, engagement shit ect. Have fun when you drop or snap your tiny card and potentially lose some or all of your media. 

People aren't little bitches for not hoarding shitty videos you rarely watch anyway
You’re speaking for everyone so, I guess I’m wrong in my own experience and everyone else in r/iPhone who is dying for the SE lineup to return.
LG V-series. At least the V20 and 30. If you Google around there is a lot of info out there about it and quite a community of enthusiasts.

Sorry you barely ever do things that are interesting or noteworthy, but that's still not a reason to bow down to these companies taking away useful features for no reason
I'm not speaking for everyone, the sales did. The phone sold because it was iOS for $500. Lower specs. You said it had the same specs and it absolutely did not.

I'd love a small uncompromised phone myself. I've accepted that they don't sell so I'll probably never get one.

Every generations of SEs had one year old SOCs. They used one generation previous. That’s close enough to be considered current gen given the yearly release and hardly massive increase in performance especially the last two. 

Sure, it lacked some features like faceID but people STILL prefer that to FaceID in some respects.
But the cameras on the front and back were worse the display was worse, features were missing etc etc. Like what are we talking about? It wasn't just the current gen Pros in a smaller package. It was just a shittier phone. People want a small phone that runs smoothly and has good cameras. These don't actually sell well.
I never said it was the same as the Pro devices spec wise. Just that it was current gen, I should've clarified I meant SOC wise. They have the same camera specs as the previous gen (6-12 months old) hardware, minus the big things like FaceID but I expect that to change. 

The people buying the SE versions of Apple Product don't need or care for some of the things that the Pro devices. I have the apple watch SE because I don't need an oxygen sensor or AOD, I'm happy with the performance alone. That's all that matters and I expect most of SE users just care it PERFORMS well.",2025-01-29 19:17:53,206,123,https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9a-release-date
Android,The non-Ultra Samsung Galaxy S series hasn't had a significant improvement in the camera department ever since the S20 five years ago,"Let that sink in.

The S21 had the same camera hardware as the S20. The S22 got a marginally bigger main sensor and optical zoom compared to the S21, but the output was essentially unchanged. Now the S25 is using identical camera hardware to the S22.

Samsung seems to be improving on every front except for the cameras (and the batteries). Even the base iPhone now has autofocus on the ultrawide camera while the S25 does not. And let's not talk about the iPhone 16 Pro or the Google Pixel 9 which use larger sensors.

Comments:
Also they’ve never properly fixed shutter lag/slow shutter speeds. They’re great cameras at static shots and portraits but good luck taking a good photo of a moving kid or pet.
And it's why I switched after exclusively using S series for nearly 8 years. Been using the base S series since the S8 since I prefer good cameras + small sized phone. Been using the S22 since its release and never upgraded it to a later S model because the cameras never got upgrades. With the S25 release I got tired of it, my S22 battery was crapping out so I went with the current best small phone with good cameras: Pixel 9 Pro. I miss some oneUI features but it's a better phone in every way.
Yeah but the iPhone and pixel are not that different either.  Issue is their haven't been major innovations in sensor technology.  Really there is a limit to what the sensor can achieve due to the physics of how light works.  It's why large sensor DSRL cameras from 15 years ago can still best a tiny smartphone sensor.  Hell physical 35mm film camera can beat your smartphone in quality.  There is literally only so much light a tiny sensors can capture.  This is why they have been using AI and computational photography to help make up the difference but anyone with a proper APSC or large format sensor camera knows a smartphone still can't touch the quality of those dedicated cameras.  Smartphones replaced most point and shoot camera because of convenience and point and shoots had smaller sensors not too much larger than a smartphone sensor.
Yep, and this is why I won't be buying another Samsung when I replace my S21.
Yup this is why I left Samsung after the s22 ultra. I just feel like they don't care about the cameras anymore despite how much they talk about them
But Samsung could do so much to improve the cameras: they could use larger sensors like the Sony LYT-900, switch to glass optics instead of plastic, improve the processing algorithm, fix shutter lag, etc. There is huge room for improvement since they are so behind the competition.
Forget even sensor size, the lens phones use is trash, a 1 inch phone gets demolished in level of detail by a good 1 inch pocket camera
They could use the LYT-900, but choose not to.
They are not behind.  Look at unbiased comparison videos.  Even then you only see differences in color science and 400x zoomed in images lol.",2025-01-29 10:22:15,41,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1icqr76/the_nonultra_samsung_galaxy_s_series_hasnt_had_a/
Android,Exclusive: Here's How Much The Google Pixel 9a Will Cost,"

Comments:
Saved you a click. FTA: In the US, the Google Pixel 9a will be priced at $499 for the 128GB model, and $599 for the 256GB model.
Why are they still charging $100 to add 128 GB?
Overpriced
Put the price in the title next time instead of perpetuating clickbait.
We need a saved you a click bot , fr
Consider the following. This phone will ship with the Tensor G4 but Pixel 8 modem. The Pixel 10a will ship with the Tensor G4 again, and you better hope it gets the Pixel 9 modem. It will need it for SOS.
Man, $809 for the 256GB in Canada? And it's supposed to be the budget version...
I feel good getting my 9 pro for $650
Overpriced for a glossy back.
The ""cheap"" pixel will get a 5100mah battery and the s25u has a 5000mah battery, that is something to think about...
> The Pixel 9a will sport a 5,100mAh capacity battery, which is the largest battery that Google has ever put into a Pixel smartphone
So how I'm looking at this is, it's the same phone with a bigger battery?
Definitely gonna wait for the sale on this one.
Is that what the 9a really gonna be looked like?
I wonder how many grams the weight is. I'm rocking a S21 ultra but find the weight unbearable even with a clear case.
By the time my 6a hits EoL, the a-serie will probably be $699.
Pixel know what they are doing
What's better 9 or 9a?
That's a lot of money for an unreliable (see all previous pixel issue, last one is pixel 4a battery), inefficient (tensor g4 still crap compared to snapdragon), barely working (can't make call if you don't have cell signal) and simply pretentious phone (pixel is is the most locked down ui, much worst than even apple 👍).

In my country the pixel 8a went out at the same price, it's been regularly sold at 200 or 250€ from one month after release to the last 3 or 4 month. 

I would say it's a ok phone for 250€. But 500€ is so pretentious, you got to have a great product first to be able to sell it.
Man, a few years ago those prices were like pixel 6 launch prices (or 2 months after launch). Feels bad man
So that'll be £500. You can buy a full fat Pixel 9 for £530. You'd have to be an idiot to buy this at full price.
Doing the lord's work
Completely insane that it's an extra $100 to jump up to 256gb.
What the hell, this used to be a budget/midrange phone.
With the Jurassic Era Tensor chip, they should keep 9A 256 GB at 450 dollars. 
I don't know from where do they get the confidence to sell it at 600 usd.
I would have understood if Pixel 9 series is very optimised like iphones but that's not the case.
Camera is lagging these days as well, edge detection remains a problem in 9 series as well.
Man in these times orgs are selling anything in the name of brand.
Too expensive. It would not be so bad if it was 256GB for $500. $100 more for 256GB is a rip off. 

I wonder how long will they continue using 128GB as price gauging tool for 256GB. Eventually those UFS3.1 factories will need to be closed down.
Thank you kind sir. Please take my upvote!

Too expensive
To make us subscribe to Google One
Profit
It was $60 before Pixel 9. Pixel 8a is 128GB for $499, 256GB for $559.
Pure profit
Because you want it and you can't add it yourself afterward, so you're willing to pay for it.

Apple figured it out a long time ago. This is how they increase their profit margins.

We all learned a long time ago that soda at fast food restaurants only costs them pennies, but they still charge 10x markup on them and we still buy them. Or movie theaters with crazy concession prices. It's just how they make their money.
$100 for 128GB of ufs 3.1
It's definitely on the expensive side and I think Google could have gotten away with making it a $50 increase. 

You can purchase 128GB & 256GB flash drives for way less than $100 that have the same speeds. Considering Google is purchasing these storage options at bulk pricing, this makes it even cheaper for them. 

Maybe worth keeping an eye out for flash sales a couple months after launch to save a few bucks.
Real price, no gimmicks
We aren't allowed to.
How will they make money if they do that?
Right now Samsung has great preorder deals on the S25. Got the base 25 256gb for 600 all in. Pixel phones flagship price for mid range hardware 
For Pro users, you get garbage!

The Pixel 6 launched at $599 in 2021, which is [$683.50 in today's dollars](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=599&year1=202110&year2=202412).
The 4a really was the peak of Pixel line. Not massive, only $349, nice plastic, great cameras and easy to root and hide it.
Inflation and cross nation import taxes. :/
Where? I mostly see it advertised for £800
Really, if you wait like 3 months after the launch, the price will go down by at least $100 or put on sale for a period of time. I just purchased a pixel 9 pro for $850 and then the next day, it went back to $1000.
I bought my 7a pretty much on release day and got it for 350€ instead of 499€. So if you play your cards right, you can probably get the 9a at a similar price
The 9a will also be available discounted in the same way, I'm sure you could get it under 400 in a few months after march.
Yea you are comparing MSRP for a phone that hasn't launched vs sale price on a phone that's been out for 6mo.. not exactly apples::apples.
[deleted]
Not everyone needs more than 126GB. I'm totally happy with my current 126GB storage.
128gb is a hell of a lot of storage if you don't record 4k video. I record at 1080p because I don't want to pay more for cloud backup storage. Haven't even come close to filling 128gb on any of my phones.

Obviously more is better, but the vast majority of phone buyers aren't going to come close to ever filling up 128gb.
This has to be the main driver. Surely they could sell more 256gb phones and still make more profit on devices if the up charge was reasonable. They are making it so people won't buy them but they can say they offer larger capacity.
Yup and that's why android phones got rid of the SD card
[From Nothing's video](https://i.imgur.com/GyOMM5j.png), a 16GB ram/1TB ufs 4.0 board cost $90
I see what you did there! Obie Trice ;)
They created a monster because nobody wants to see Pixel no more, they want Nexus
No routines, no desktop mode, no widget stacks, no bg remove in photos, poor lockscreen customization but we get emoji kitchen and pixel Studio instead...
OP isn't making money by not including the price, though.
Man inflation hits hard
Still using my 4a..
It actually got cheaper compared to the prior 3a, while giving you more. I'm never giving up my 4a, it still has an amazing camera.
Sounds like it was the Nexus 5 of the Pixel phones.
For me it was the Pixel 5. I didn't like the under-screen speaker [and frankly prefer iOS over Android, but that's a different story], but other than that it really struck the right balance between size, battery, screen, cameras, materials and performance.
as a victim of ""battery update""... what is your suggested root tool/firmware?

i really had zero complaints with my 2yo 4a... and if i could have scraped off half of the garbage that i never use.... would be the best phone ever.
Now the initial price is higher but the trade in bonuses make up for the difference.
Yup. Kept mine from launch to the Pixel 8 and for as much as I like the 8 I still miss the 4a.
Keep an eye on HotUKDeals.com
It's As apples:apples as it gets.

As a consumer I can spend £30 more to get a significant upgrade. The 9a at launch price has virtually no value proposition when the model up has already dropped to the same price.

128GB is not a lot of storage, lmao.

The over 10 year old iPhone 6 had 128GB.

I'd say normies are pretty close to 128GB these days. Just from their photos alone.
That's not why Android OEM's got rid of it.

They were actually shrinking storage not even offering larger capacity android phones during tje period it was phased out.

It was a cost cutting measure.
SD was slow & clunky. Apps couldn't really be installed to them, so it was only for cold storage. Then the customers always bitched about it not working, or the card getting knocked loose when they dropped the phone, or it being corrupted or it not mounting correctly after they switched to a new phone, etc...   
I'd personally rather have more internal storage taking up the space where the SD slot was.   
If I need to offload my phone, I use a USB-C flash drive or external SSD. With that, I can plug it into anything. SD cards you had to have a reader, and those were always shit. I don't miss SD storage at all.

Yeah it's rough to see it so obviously like this 😑
Same here! It's honestly still running great
Yeah, I had a 3a before it and was reluctant to move because of the increased screen size. Ended up moving the screen below the hole punch and it wasn't bad except for the lack of bottom bezel. Mine will keep living on for the free photo uploads.
That's because they shifted the entire Pixel line after 3 and 3a
Man I loved my Nexus 5. If it hadn't gotten misplaced (maybe taken by staff) on an international trip, I might never have replaced it.
Man… if we don’t count the speaker (I liked not having hole above display but sound was awful) it was the best phone I’ve ever had since Nexus 6. Id love to get same design just with better specs

Lineageos has been pretty smooth for me.
Love that website
You could also just get an S24U on sale for $500, save even more money and have an even faster phone! Apples to apples right? 

How is Google going to continue to exist with savvy consumers like you out there?!

The OnePlus 6 was $529 in 2018, which is about [$663 in today's dollars](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=529&year1=201805&year2=202412)
I take a LOT of photos and videos of my kids, and my Pixel 8 wasn't over 90gb from launch day until I wiped it last week. And when it does fill up, I can clear it out with one button press. 128GB is plenty for moderate users. If you want more, the option is there.
Can you install apps on your cloud storage?

All the things you list sound like fantasy problems. Sd cards getting knocked loose? What?
If a price in parentheses at the end of a title gets a post removed for editorialization then the mods need to take a look in the mirror.
Reddit as a whole does not allow you to edit titles.
That's a completely different phone from a different release cycle by a different manufacturer. Not even a similar comparison.
funny enough, the sd card knocking loose holds some truth to it. i once dropped my phone and it must have knocked the sim card loose or something because i lost reception until i reseated the thing. considering sim cards and sd cards share the same caddy, it's feasible for that to happen
Android itself gave up the ability to install apps to SD storage somewhere around versions 8 or 9. 
Even they knew it was wasted. 


And even when it was supported, app developers had to code-in support for it. Which most didn't, so it rarely worked correctly.
it is a rule, you cannot change the title of the article, it is actually a pretty fair rule to the site, there is no looking in the mirror required
So as long as you make up the criteria then they aren't comparable. Got it. 

The A and the Pro release cycles are already different. So how about a Pixel 8 Pro vs the 9a.. or even an 8a? Imagine the savings. 

Are those comparable enough (same chip, same manufacturer) or do you need to move the goal posts some more?
I suppose anything is possible. But it's a wild reason to use to argue that removing SD cards was a good thing.
I don't care though. You're bringing up apps not working on SD cards as if cloud storage runs apps.

I need SD cards for storing other files. Video, pictures, music etc. Etc.
The 9a is specifically created by Google to be a cheaper version of the Pixel 9. That's the whole value proposition. The clue is in the name. It's not like I'm making it up: that's Google's market strategy.

And unfortunately, at the time of release it compares unfavourably because you can buy a Pixel 9 for about 5% more from the same retailers. It is launching with no value proposition.",2025-01-27 16:12:00,161,100,https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-9a-pricing
Android,Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Google Pixel 9: You can’t go wrong with either,"

Comments:
Jeez this thread really opened up the fanboy wars. I feel like the pixel vs samsung wars haven't been this bad since the 2017-2018 smartphone era
They said that indoor photography improved this generation. Didn't they say that before? I mostly traded in my S24 Ultra for the Pixel 9 Pro XL because I've always been a point-and-shooter. Indoor (with light!) would still take 5 seconds on the Galaxy. And would look worse than the screen grain everyone got. The only thing I'd add to the Pixel is more color options for the OS ☺️
unless you play heavy games and want strong performance, then you can definitely go wrong
Snapdragon 8 elite blows google’s tensor out of the water.
Tensor chip, no UFS 4.0 but of course if it's from Google that's not an issue. Pixel is not a flagship phone period. You can't charge flagship price for subpar hardware.
> Best Tensor performance yet 

That means nothing. 

The S25 should have the following in its list of cons: 

- Still starting with 128GB of storage. 
- Uses outdated camera hardware. 
- Does not use silicon-carbon battery.
The S25 (especially the Ultra) is better. The Snapdragon chip inside is just objectively way more powerful. Google does come out on top with photos. Though, I'd say Samsung's cameras are still really good and competitive with Pixel and iPhones even if they're not upgrading the camera hardware as frequently as they used to. There's plenty to criticize Samsung about in terms of not doing enough to upgrade their phones from year to year, but the Ultra is still one of the best phones on the market right now. Especially if we're talking the NA market where there aren't really any of the Chinese phones to choose from. Not to mention, OneUI is the best version of Android right now. Super customizable with GoodLock, too.

I'm considering upgrading my S23 Ultra to the S25 Ultra even though there aren't *huge* improvements in a ton of areas. Samsung's trade offers, the free storage upgrade, etc. are good deals and are tempting me. I can get the phone for $550 with 512 GB of storage. If I wait for the S26 Ultra, it's likely my S23 Ultra will only be worth $500 or less instead of the $750 being offered for it now. That's not to say I don't have criticisms, but I'd take Samsung over a Pixel any day.
You can go wrong if you prefer not having a permanent Google search bar on your home screen.
One UI is superior
Two of the most popular android phones both with heaps of compromises. 

It's insane that Samsung hasn't updated their camera hardware in 4 years. Not to mention no silicone carbon battery when other phones already have it.

Honestly the most pathetic update I have seen from any phone company i think ever. Even behind apple in incremental updates. 

No wonder why their stocks have dropped by like 30%.
Too bad the much more powerful processor on the S25 can't run GrapheneOS :(
I never understood people who buy a Samsung and try to cope with the fact they still can't shoot moving objects, kids and pets. It's literally never been fixed, it's been there forever. Snapdragon X Elite Ultra 1000 ain't gonna fix that either I guess. Sorry, I can't compromise my life moments just to game on a phone.
Just bought a new phone yesterday! Been using Samsung since the S8, so the release of the S25 was a no-brainer for me!


-Sent from my Pixel 9 Pro
4000mah in 2025 should be illegal

Edit: specifically the new expensive 600€+ phones, I mean cmon
Wow such scrutinizing consumer reports here. /S

Honestly I think there's plenty of criticism for both of these phones 

I won't repeat all the criticisms for the s25 since at this point they're well known but I am normally a pixel user and I love the new design ever since the Pixel 6.

I was frustrated these years seem in my opinion at least in North America YouTube a double standard were pixels. I thought the coverage was unfair.

It's strange that the media opinion has turned with the Pixel 9 of all devices since the internals are functionally identical. The silicon is still on Samsung and not TSMC yet. Performance is barely different at all from the older devices. 

Functionally the only difference is that it is square design now and it cost more money 

2 years in a row they had price increases. In the case of the Pixel 7 pro it was $960 for the 256 GB model and now it's $240 more to get that Pixel 9 pro XL MSRP. Still with 128 GB of storage and the same inferior Samsung internals 

I am really excited to see what TSMC will do to the pixels but if you didn't like the Pixel 8 pro it's bizarre that everyone like the Pixel 9 pro. It seems like it's just bc it looks more like an iPhone 

I would much rather have the pixel 8 pro and you can find it for 350 bucks on Amazon renewed.
If you are seriously considering an s25, just buy and s24 instead
They made the same comparison to the s24 with the pixel 9 lol now they're doing it with the s25?
Pixel phones are not worth the money. If they were priced at 599 for the 9, 699 for 9 Pro and 749 for the XL they’d actually have a decent offering. 

OnePlus has better phones in every single way for cheaper. And Samsung actually gives you a feature set that’s worth the asking price
Samsung has a better soc and worse software
Don't really have a ball in this game, got the pixel 9 plus on a deal for 200. I enjoy it a lot more than my old s21. The camera is stunning. I haven't noticed any stuttering or anything, software is great. That's all I really care about. The pixel camera upgrade from Samsung is pretty crazy.
Picked up a Pixel 9 Pro and just loving the phone so far.  What I would recommend.

Samsung phones come with way too much bloatware, IMO.
I agree that tensor and Snapdragon are completely different ball games, tensor is shit compared to SD However if you're not a heavy user or use a phone for gaming the pixel is a very solid phone. I'm looking forward to the TMSC pixel 10
One is an aged, overhyped disaster in desperate need for a refreshed design.

The other is an overheating mess.
You can also just skip this gen to zero loss
just got moto razr couple of weeks ago. Kinda done with slab, regardless the technology- it's not excite me more. even my s10 still works fine for what i need.
Aren't both...expensive?
you can also go wrong with both (before you hate: i have a s23 but i acknowledge the bs samsung has pulled this year)
S25 is way cheaper, wins on price
So I know mine are old, but my biggest issue with my pixel 6 vs my s22 is that I can't get my pixel to connect to anything, or mirror screen etc. Zero issues with my s22. Did pixel move on from Chromecast only yet?I actually really like my pixel and would like to try the 9 xl.
So I started my Journey with a Samsung S9 in 2019 which lasted about 3 years and was on its last leg and was offered a free swap to the S22 base as I like smaller phones a couple of months after release.

This past Friday morning I woke up and the phone was completely fried, as in dead. It gave me zero warning and something tells me the last security update after at least 4 days would not download as I tried about 10 times.

Short story longer, I was in a rush to get a working phone and ended up with a Pixel 9 after being offered the S24 Ultra. The S24 was too large for my needs, and without really any research went with the Pixel 9 base.
I left the store with a little bit of a sinking feeling if you will...

So now after 6 days, I'm digging this Pixel 9 a ton.
It may be just because moving from Samsung to Google is giving me a different experience, which is a better experience So far. 

The S22 battery Is well documented as being terrible because of its size, and I'm enjoying a lot more battery life and just a different phone which in my mind might as well be Androids flagship. It's solid AF. 
The S series Samsungs are great, but the time had come for a change

I'm an Android fanboi 🏃‍♂️ and I'll fight anyone with my fists if needed at any time If they start talking smack about iPhone being so much better than Android. Of course I'm joking kind of ...because I sucker punch them and run for my life

Thanks everyone stay safe out there and take care ✨💫
One can run GrapheneOS, the other can't...
Yeah you definitely can go wrong 
Just bought a pixel 9 for 650€ but I'm finding it hard to get used to the software coming from a xiaomi phone. Is it worth getting an s25 for 100€ more? I'm planning on keeping the device for at least 4 years 
You can easily go wrong if you get a pixel over samsung. Even the specs are lacking. 
it depends where you live at. 
If it's cold out there, i would go for the pixel because it's like a pocket size heater. you enable 5g, or you launch something somewhat intensive and you warm yourself up.

now if you live in a hot place, then it's samsung, with it's snapdragon processor... it stays cold as a rock.

Google have been going hard on the northern market since the pixel 6 and it's home made tensor cpu mini heater.
the Pixel 9 at least has 4700mAh, the base S25 has 4000mAh, i dont care how optimized your OS is, 4000mAh isnt all day for a modern phone.
Oppo find x8 better than both
Those of you who obsess over phones or act like every new one should be packed full of new tech are really weird.   It's a phone, they're all a screen on the front and some cameras on the back.  Choose one and go on with your lives.  Seriously, people.
Spend half as much and get 13R and get 90% of the same experience. And much better experience in other ways like battery, charging speed etc.
Pixel: The only phone that allows custom OSes and has the most secure Titan M3
You can go wrong with both, get the Vivo x200 pro mini
Yes you can. Samsung insists on automatically lowering the ringtone volume when the phone is inside a purse or a pocket, leading to a countless number of important missed calls. I have tried everything, disabled every ""smart"" feature. I will never buy another Samsung phone for my parents until they allow you to disable this.
Yes you can, the S25 camera is the worst
Any movement and it will be blurry, since the s22 they say they fixed the shutter in the next phone and it's still the same
 ultra is worse
You can go wrong, the base S25 has horrendous battery life. I'm an S24 user for a year now, with a Find X8 of similar size which blows it away.
Weird comparison considering the Pixel 10 is about to come out early this year.
Samsung makes the best phone overall 

Pixel quality is   trash and super buggy 


Samsung still undefeated never lost

I didn't realize there was a fanboy divide inside the android ecosystem.  Android vs iPhone, okay whatever, it's stupid but I get it kinda.   But Android vs Android?  Wtf people.  Stopping fawning over multi-billion dollar global corporate monopolies.
I was a Pixel LOVER for many, many years. Then I bought a Galaxy S23 Ultra and am struggling to comprehend how the Koreans made such an incredible and damn near perfect piece of tech, with software that does not bug out like mad, whereas my pixel's bugginess I deluded myself into believing it was just part of the Pixel ""charm"" and it ""isn't that bad."" No, Google doesn't care about fixing the severe bugginess of their operating system or apps. It's a shame because the UI is quite nice, and the interconnectedness of Google's services baked into the phone's operating system was unique and beautiful, but it was so, so buggy. Love the S23 Ultra and I don't think I'll ever go back to Pixel, especially because the design of the new Pixels is not to my taste, and the camera functionality of the Pixel simply cannot compete with Samsung's, even though it's pretty good.
/r/android is mostly children with low effort comments. I only rarely visit the last few years.
Sammies need something to grasp onto since it's the same phone this year again 
Yeah honestly there's plenty of criticism for both of these phones.

I think you could make a compelling argument that nobody should buy either of these phones at least not brand new and at least not now. By the s23 or the Pixel 8 pro or something and save yourself 700 bucks.
They say it's better every year, and that it's all thanks to the new chip because the old powerful chip couldn't do it any better despite having the same hardware...
You're getting down voted but you're not wrong.

The Tensor G4 and Snapdragon 8 Elite are wildly different chips when it comes to performance. Power efficiency too when it comes to that. 


In 95% of cases the people on the sub will be the only ones to notice the difference in real life though.
Afaik, my Pixel 8 is not much weaker than a Pixel 9 and I get stutter just scrolling in apps. The specs in the Pixel phones are simply not enough.
Or photos of your kids or animals (other than sloths), then you can also go wrong, but this time with the Samsung.
I can play wreck fest smoothly on my pixel 9 pro.
It's not only about strong performance but also future-proofing. My pixel 7 became a potato after 2 years, heating and lagging during navigation + music in AA.
Or possibly wanting a phone with a functioning GPS.
Idk man, [Infinity Nikki](https://x.com/pearpal_nikki/status/1859883303349964807?s=19), a game that came out in December 2024, already set the record for the most demanding minimum & reccomended specs (Dimensity 8200/Snapdragon 888 minimum, Dimensity 9200/Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 reccomended)




And [Arknights: Endfield](https://youtu.be/UbMmSdOJ1Ho?si=XMvYq6feYgbwToDN) is already shaping up to be the most demanding game of 2025, bc of both it's graphics and the fact that it's a factory builder, a genre known to be very CPU intensive
Yes, the Pixel 9 Pro is the better option for most people unless you are deep into the Samsung ecosystem, or play games heavily.
Even average performance is bad in pixel.
And the Qualcomm modem
In what? Most people don't play Genshin impact mate. And the Pixel 9 has decent battery life anyway!
and? if you aren't gaming on a cell phone that makes as much difference as a 5090 vs 1070 if all you do is play indie games. although I did go with the s25 ultra cause for whatever reason google fi gives shitty deals for their own phones and amazing deals for samsung, plus I don't wanna adjust to a new UI.
That's the thing, before they would offer this sub par hardware at a reasonable price and the software would cover up for it. Now it's unacceptable to charge as much as what Samsung and Apple charges while providing a processor that barely holds up against an equivalent snapdragon from 3 generations back. I really don't know what Google is thinking.
This is correct. Pixel IS a good phone, but it IS NOT a flagship phone, even if they use it and market it as a flagship phone.
That's why the Pixel A lineup is much better. 

The flagship lineup has battery issues always. Modem sux big time.

Got no choice but to go Samsung. Cross finger to green lines.
Samsung: Hold my beer!
>Pixel is not a flagship phone period. 


If you're into photography, it's THE flagship, no other Android phone really comes close. And in the end some people will always favor having great pictures of their family and travels other than feeling the phone 200ms snappier.
> You can't charge flagship price for subpar hardware.

You can. **Samsung does this all the time** and half this subreddit eats it all up no questions asked.
> Uses outdated camera hardware.

> Does not use silicon-carbon battery.

Those are not really cons in themselves, the actual con would be ""worse battery life"", ""longer charge time"", and ""worse picture/video quality"". If they somehow managed to be on par with the pixel 9 without those they would hardly be ""cons"", just technical choices.

At the end of the day all that matters is the actual performance of the device, not how it's achieved.
> Still starting with 128GB of storage. 

only on the S25 base, both the S25+ and S25 Ultra start at 256GB of storage.

S25 base does offer a 256GB and 512GB option.

So you can get the S25 in any trim you want with 256GB.
If people are WILLING to buy a phone with 128GB of storage, the tech overlords are gonna let it be an option, and the same can be said about the outdated hardware.
My Samsung A52 that's almost 4 years old has 128 GB of storage and an SD slot. I wouldn't buy a phone with only 128 GB and no extra storage, especially with such a high resolution camera.
The S24 has such insanely bad cameras it's actually pathetic. Any slight movement and it's a blur, and zooming in on any of the details, especially text, is just a smear.


It's wild how Samsung is so far behind in cameras.
I was actually looking forward to upgrade to the s25 Ultra from my S21 Ultra. I am not going to now mainly because of them removing bluetooth from the SPen.
- OneUI and ugly Squircles embedded everywhere.
- Camera oversaturates all your photos
- Camera still can't photograph moving subjects without blur
S-pen is not wireless anymore
I was able to trade my s22u in for 600, paying about 700usd for the s25u, bud3pro, and a few other accessories. Figure with these sort of trade-in deals through Samsung, if the s26u is a bigger upgrade, probably not gonna cost but another couple hundred to trade in next year, and hopefully get some more free add-ons.

I'm usually buying refurbished or second hand, but if you catch the right offer from Samsung, it's almost a no-brainer to just get it through them.

Only thing that sucks is that sometimes I'm in a state with pre-trade-in value tax. So you end up paying tax on the full amount, instead of the discounted price.
Permanent? Or you just use a different launcher?
Also the weight. I moved from Pixel 5 to 9 pro a few days ago and I hate the weight of it.
S25 is under 170g and that would be much closer to my preferred phone weight.
And the dreadful At a Glance widget that may or may not by legible on your wallpaper choice
[deleted]
I'd take that in a second over the mountains of sludgeware that are on every Samsung product I've ever owned.
Sure, but I downloaded another launcher once and never worried about that issue again.
Yeah, as a new owner of my first pixel this forced upon me apple style shit was infuriating.

Installed nova launcher and it's been rock solid.
The customization with goodlock is amazing, I am not sure why google is so scared to give users the option to make their phone work/look how they like.
Agree, I prefer Samsung's version on Android but is true that they are taking us for granted at this point.
I’d go for it for the flawless native call recorder alone. No “alert the other party” iPhone bs
Samsung always was ahead with TouchWiz, but it felt so bloated. What they have done with OneUI is amazing. Fluid, customizable, extensible. Doesn’t feel bloated at all.
By far the best Android skin these days. I'm also not a huge fan of Material You. It's too flat for me.

I do wish Samsung would default to not using squirqle icons though. They look ridiculous. Thankfully you can modify that with Good Lock.
Don't think pixel is in ""most popular"" league. That would be Samsung, iPhone, Xiaomi, oppo, vivo. Google is even below Huawei, Realme and Redmi.
The S25 Ultra has a new ultra wide camera, 50MP instead of 12MP.  Additionally, there is improved image processing and software updates.  

As for silicone carbon batteries, they are just now becoming the norm and neither Apple or Samsung have introduced them but are reportedly developing them and will begin using them soon.  

Stock price has been down since November on fears of tariffs.  Same goes for other companies that rely on the USA for a large portion of their sales. 

You sure do have some sort of vendetta against Samsung, but try being truthful with your comments.
And pixel still don't have vapour chamber in the normal 9. It heats up just like me mates 8 and my 7. Even all the same, I'd rather choose the s25  than the base 9
Is this a new thing? I have an s20 and have never had this issue
Honor is heavily promoting its X9C phone here in Malaysia. It has a freaking 6600mAh battery, a free screen replacement for a year if you damaged it and a 3 year battery replacement if your battery health is under 80%, and it's priced just shy of $300
Yeah. My $250 phone has a bigger battery and more storage.
I know on the other sub forums people claim that the P9pro has fixed all the battery issues that the P8pro had as far as lasting a full day. I know on my P7 my battery is horrible and I can't even turn on 5G as it will kill my battery before I'm even half way through the day. And all I do is occasional reddit and then listen to music for 2 hours of the day so not a heavy user (Amazon music with screen turned off). I'm looking for a new phone to get better battery life but pixel is seriously concerning me as my last several pixels have been worse than the competition in battery life. Everything else though I love about pixel but I may have to jump ship to S25 ultra this year to see if it's any better 
S25 with preorder deals are cheaper than S24 from reputable sellers though, unless you buy used, or at least from what I can find. Been looking for an S24 Ultra but it seems like it's still at least 1k for it now new
s25 snapdragon is better than s24 exynos..
They cost basically the same at my companies service provider and I get a huge discount if I buy through my company...  

I could buy an s24 on sale on Amazon for a lot less, but it would still cost as much as or more than a s25 if I buy it through my employer.
Glad that I did. I managed to get the S24+ 256GB for USD620.
Pay more to get last year's phone?

With pre-order bonuses and discounts the s25u is cheaper than the s24u. For the latest phone with a better chip and other small upgrades, it's an easy choice.
Quiet common as Samsung phone launches have always been happening in feb while most others are launched in oct.
Worth depends on the person. For me, the Pixel gets the least spam calls of any device I've ever owned, by far. I would honestly pay Google $1.99/mo just to have access to the ability to reduce spam calls if it was an add on for Google One subscription.
I got my pixel 9 pro for $300 around thanksgiving on mint mobile. Idk why they were so cheap but I upgraded from a s21 ultra and it's been very nice. No complaints so far I do much prefer the camera and dimensions of the phone. 
you guys are way too caught on specs like this is still 2013

after using an S24U, a OnePlus 12 and P9PXL it's just so much more enjoyable using a Pixel. Experience is the value to consumers at this point, and for ME and a lot of others, there's intangible features and an intangible experience that other manufacturers cannot replicate. You guys are spinning your wheels trying to justify spec sheets and ""better in every single way"" but that's just not correct because ""better"" is becoming increasingly subjective in this space
Let me guess you are the type of people who think non removable apps are completely not bloatware because they are made from Google right? You can talk about Samsung having bloatware when you can uninstall, replace, remove any of the google apps that are forced upon you in the Pixel, which is not the case at the moment. You can't remove the stupid Google search in the Pixel but that's not bloatware right?
you mean you prefer Google's bloatware over samsung's
Aren’t they both $800?
well they both lasts 5hrs-6hrs
S25 is smaller and lighter than Pixel 9.

S25 is pretty much the smallest phone, which is still decent.
You're hanging out on a very strange sub Reddit if that's how you feel about phone fanatics.
Well if you are paying flagship money then people ought to care about it.
Except the 13R is considerably bigger than the S25 and 27% heavier as well. Those are things that matter to people, especially those considering smaller (and in case of the S25 at least also lighter) phones in the first place.

And for what it's worth, at least where I live, an S25 + a decent 2 year contract is cheaper than a 13R without any sort of contract.
[deleted]
>  secure Titan M3

This has been amazing year after year, no one's been able to crack'em yet.
I heard s25 fixed it.
6.2"" and 6.6"", you could have simply said ""bigger""
How do u know about the s25 battery life even before its been shipped to customers? Or are u assuming this based off the s24? Then I'm assuming your s24 was the exynos variant.
Not weird at all. The S24 line up also beat the Pixel 9 lineup and it was released in January last year. Pixel hasn't even been out for 6 months yet. Cope
Its.not fanboism as much as it's a disappointment in seeing the 2 largest companies who sell Android phones in NA not push each other.

In one corner we Samsung who is the king, unthreathened a year anyone while selling very very very iterative and repeat phones without really pushing Android further. The S25 series is the perfect example of this. Even the S24 series in Europe proved this too as the S24 & S24+ ship with a vastly inferior chip than what other flagships offer.


Then we have Google, held back by the Tensor. The owners of Android can't/won't offer a device with flagship performance,  or at least a device that's priced to match. Their cameras are seriously good, and Google has a good thing with the design and software. But performance sucks. Period. I never had as bad of performance in Firefox than i did on my Pixel  7Pro. Even the S21U was smooth.

So now shit is stagnant. Samsung won't push the envelope and Google is stuck in its pride to keep offering a subpar SoC.
Competition is good.  It's great that within android users have two very strong platforms to choose from.  One reason I moved from iPhone back to Android.  I love all the phone options.
Funnily enough, I too have an S23 Ultra after owning the Pixel 6 and 7, but even though the S23 Ultra is the most complete phone I've had, I still want Google to fix their phones. I love everything about my S23 Ultra but having owned a Pixel before the cameras IMO are just better. It doesn't matter how far I can zoom out or the megapixels if Samsung still refuses to fix the shutter lag (No Goodlock camera assistant doesn't actually fix it).

But as it stands I also can't imagine going back until Google does away with Tensor or at least makes something equivalent and fixes their hardware issues like inconsistent network performance and a battery that doesn't require charging at mid day so I don't have to scramble to get home with less than 15% left.
I’m experiencing Stockholm Syndrome from my time with the Pixel because everyone I notice some minor bug on my new iPhone, I think “hehe so it’s not just magic after all, it’s a computer 🤭” and not “WHY ARE APPLE AND GOOGLE RELEASING SUCH GLARINGLY FLAWED SOFTWARE”
Eh, I've used Pixel, Samsung, and Oneplus over the years and every year has been incremental in upgrades. Day to day use between brands isn't big enough to justify the fanboying imo
It most definitely is a phone. Out of the lineup of 2025 phones, it is one of them. (still might get it)
But they are going to troll apple fanboys for having the same phone every year
And yet the pixel is still behind.
My issue is the price and borderline lies Google puts out with regards to tensor. Most people don't need more power than a tensor, sure, but that's mid-range to low range territory where a phone should cost less than 500.

The difference in power between the snapdragon 8 elite and a Google tensor chip is literally a 3 or 4 generation difference in performance, if not more. It's completely fine to say pixels are powerful enough for 90% of people (they probably are), but it's not ok to brush aside the price they charge. Simply put, you're paying for 4 year old technology as if it's bleeding edge and just because it's not immediately apparent, a lot of people brush it off.

Again, it's totally fine if a consumer KNOWS they are getting a mid-range chip and still chooses to pay for a pixel, there's plenty to love about them. But as consumers, we shouldn't gaslight our fellow consumers that they're not overpaying or that they aren't receiving a mid-range product for $1000+. Pixels are niche compared to other brands so of course there will be a premium, but they're wildly overcharging people. This coming from someone who used Google phones for 11 years straight.
Which one will have better battery life ?

Is the tensor G4 more efficient
Yep, just clean installed the latest OS and measured the FPS in apps. It's mostly around 90-120 FPS. Which means the phone can't handle 120 Hz. And even that is after all the improvements they made. 

I don't think it's the power, it's powerful enough. It's mostly just poor optimization due to exotic hardware and Google not giving a shit because most people don't notice. Literally just one notable reviewer mentioned the stutters.
yeah there's literally nothing that makes pixel phones stand out in their price range. Back in the days they had good cameras but now it's average at everything and not better than any 300$ to 400$ phone.
yeh p8 is my biggest disappointment purchase
Makes sense since [G3 vs G4](https://nanoreview.net/en/soc-compare/google-tensor-g4-vs-google-tensor-g3) have the same performance despite new architecture and higher clocks
>animals (other than sloths)

I'll bite, is this a meme/joke I'm missing here about Samsung cameras and sloths?
They're probably talking about emulation
Phone brand tribalism is so embarrassing in 2025
My Pixel is coughing hard managing Android auto maps and spotify, literally overheating in summer months. As much as I love Pixel's camera, the chip is midrange, and they ask premium money for it.
I mean its an objective fact that the Tensor g4 is like a 2021 level SOC. Its honestly crazy to me that Google, known for crazy engineering and running the entire internet, would build an SOC this bad.
It's not just about performance, which might not matter much now but in the future it will; but also about the modems and connectivity. Tensor uses Samsung's shitty modems that drain the battery rapidly while Qualcomm's modems are considered the best and most efficient. It makes a huge difference on battery life too as with a trashy modem the phone has to waste more energy on trying to lock onto a signal compared to an efficient one.

Try taking a 4k60HDR video on both and sending it to a friend.  The Snapdragon is going to accomplish this task like a DAY faster than the Tensor, if not DAYS.
Genshin impact is cringy as fuck.  Dudes who oggle at anime girls should be ostracized cause it's a creepy behavior and our society should say ""No, motherfucker""
Nexus line was superior hardware, just had a weak camera and low to mid tier battery life. But it had storage and RAM. Then they switched to Pixel line with better camera software, but still try to charge Apple prices.
True Samsung really shat the bed this year and I hope the sold units represent that so that they learn they can't get away with it.
Still I won't switch to Pixel as it's even worse.
Pixel hasn't been the android's best camera in years.
I think we have a different approach. Yours is the end result, and mine is the exact steps that result in a certain outcome. 

For example, 

Better battery life can be achieved through throttling, limiting services, worse hardware, etc. 

Better picture/video quality can be achieved through software optimisations, fake ""AI"", etc. 

You would get better battery life and photos, but would you be happy with them being achieved through the above described methods? 

For me, I know exactly what the outcome would be from a silicon-carbon battery: Bigger battery, better battery life. 

A better camera hardware would result in more potential, which would either be unlocked immediately, or eventually, through a software update.
Lol this is utter nonsense. Phone features people desire don't work in a vacuum, just like any other product that has various features that make them appealing vs another.  If performance was all that matters rather than how it was achieved, then why bother making a plane more aerodynamic when you could just strap a bigger engine to it?  Because it costs fuel.  

Not only that, everyone benefits when technical advancements are prioritized, because everything has tradeoffs or worse performance outright without them.  Take raw SoC performance vs battery life.  They are two sides of the same coin.  More efficient transistors means outcomes like better performance with the same battery life, or the same performance with better battery life.  Not taking into consideration the means to the end is naive and short-sighted in this context.
How it's achieved can matter in some cases for instance battery life. The battery life improves 20% and you find out that's because there is major throttling.... That matters. 

That's just an example but just wanted to point that out. With cameras it's not the same thing necessarily
The problem is that there is an option. You can not buy it, pay more and get a 256GB variant, which should not be the case. In fact, the 128GB option is there only to push you towards the 256GB variant. 

Samsung is holding things back, waiting for Apple. Once Apple makes a move, Samsung will follow, as usual.
I have a seven year old phone with 128GB of storage, and I still have 57GB free. My storage is 19GB for music which I occasionally play and 12GB for photos and videos. I only took about 2500 photos during those years. I would happily buy another 128GB phone and expect to keep it another seven years, but my old phone is still holding up so I haven't bothered to replace it. I can understand why some people who are enthusiastic camera users want lots of storage, but I'd bet that most users don't take many photos.
It's really quite laughable. It means you can only use your phone in a casual manner.

If you do anything serious, or use it for an extremely long time, it's going to get full.
That's less the fault of the hardware and more about software 

Samsung has TERRIBLE noise reduction. To a completely ridiculous level. If you install Gcam or take a DNG raw and process it next to a default JPG it's dumbfounding why they apply *that much* noise reduction. 

iPhone and Pixel have much better image stacking tech that takes high shutter speed frames to freeze motion and blends them into the stack seamlessly. Samsung just lets the camera default to lower shutter speeds across the board. 

They do multi frame HDR in every photo, compiled in an instant. The hardware is completely capable of taking a fast photo. But who wants that when you can have smeary watercolors instead 😎
Yeah its mind boggling how bad Samsung cam is and I'm on a pixel for exactly this reason. It's a shame tbh as except camera Samsung dominates pretty much in everything, even software, OneUI is miles ahead of the barebones pixel.
The Cameras themselves aren't bad. It's their default shutter speed is just too slow compared to the likes of Xiaomi, Apple, Vivo and Oppo.
Consequences of extremely heavy post processing. 

The raw files show you much better is possible (and no not the proprietary Samsung ExpertRAW, that's lossy format that was just designed for enhanced editing capabilities).

You should download the camera assistant or two and try tweaking it officially through good lock. Turn on image softening for one, it's a misnamed feature that prevents over sharpening.
They really been using the same cameras since the S22 😤
Came back to Android after two iPhones (XR and 13). Bought a S24+ and the only thing which makes me miss the iPhones are the camera.

  
The forced HDR, the super slow shutter... oh boy.
Honestly my biggest buyers remorse for this phone. Unless the image is outdoors in clear day light (which I will give it the credit, looks incredible) the image comes out yellowish, smeary, flat and just generally shit. Indoors, over cast, close ups, food, etc. just look crap. 

I've tried all the tips, camera assistant, 50mp, 12mp, all setting son or off, 3rd party apps. Can't wait to swap out for a Pixel 10, I should have gotten the 9
>I was able to trade my s22u 

Same. Coming from an S22u it's going to be a pretty big upgrade, and to get it for ~$700 AUD with the new buds included is a bargain.

It may not be a huge difference from the s24u, but for those of us who don't upgrade every year it's still looking like a great phone. Fair enough if you pay RRP of like $2000+ you might be disappointed, but everyone pre-ordering is getting big discounts and it's absolutely the best phone you can get for under $1000 IMO.
On the other hand, they offered like 200$ for my S22+, which means I'd be paying 800$ for S25+ for barely any upgrade.

Third-party launchers are still extremely buggy on Android
And no option to hide the navigation pill

Samsung allows this using good lock modules. Google tells you to enjoy a white pill at the bottom of your screen always.
You can. Download Goodlock and then Theme Park to change icons.
I miss those times when each icon has its shape, without all of them being circular or square or those childish shape Samsung uses that I don't even know the name.
I switched from a Phxel to a Galaxy S23 because at the time I didn't want to have to buy a gigantic phone to get the best camera. 

I spend 20 minutes removing some Samsung native apps/unnecessary apps.  Certainly wasn't ""mountains of sludgeware"".  Device runs smooth and snappy to this day.   

I avoided Galaxy devices because of things I read here.  I'm glad I stopped listening and just trying it for myself, because people really exaggerate.
Work gave me a Samsung phone. Even though I uninstalled as much as I could and turned off all the notifications it would allow, I still get the bullshit notification to download shit Samsung apps.
Samsung does a better Job than Google with Quickshare and their Smarttag network. They keep Android competitive with iOS.
don't get them through shitty carriers and you'll be good
It's not just the insanely good GoodLock customization but also the Apple-like ecosystem benefits.

If you have a ton of Samsung gadgets, it's extra nice.
In my circle, only, I use goodlock. All other Samsung users just use with default settings, use the default apps and don't care about customization. So Google's approach is more mainstream.
Because they're trying to emulate Apple from 10 years ago.
Because options create more work under the hood, and Google is allergic to supporting features
But Samsung camera is so bad....
Yeah! I hate following the law and protecting people from malicious actors recording them without their consent!
Have you seen One UI 7 on those s25s displayed in-store? It's... so much faster. At this point it'll probably give my s21fe a new life.
Wow. An ultrawide camera that's been on other phones for years.

Silicone carbon batteries are just becoming the norm even though phones have had them for a year or so now? Honor used it last Jan already. All phones released, and upcoming by every other brand aside from Samsung and google are using silicone carbon.

I don't know enough about stocks and politics, so I can't properly comment.

I don't have a vendetta, I'm a loyalist since s6 edge.

Just frustrating to see how trash their updates have become. I'm invested in the ecosystem, and used to the OS. I use heaps of Samsung exclusive features others don't (like the Spen, I use it daily. And even that is getting a downgrade.  Great)
> As for silicone carbon batteries, they are just now becoming the norm

This is a flagship phone, it should not wait 2 iterations to catch up with ""what is becoming norm"", it should standards for the next generation before it is the norm
Its literally just pixel fanboys trying to find some win over samsung not realising they are the only ones with this issue
Man I really hope the X9c is also $300 when Honor finally starts selling phones in Indonesia




Otherwise everyone would make fun of them
Your phone is also larger. S25 is a compact phone.
S25 and S23 are both better than S24.
Yeah but how much of that is felt IRL. Slabs are boring now and folds are too expensive
You only get the max if you have last year's phone, the discounts don't go that far if you don't have an S23 or s24 ultra
Samsung does a great job at this, too. I rarely ever get any spam calls or texts anymore and if one does sneak through, it's labeled in red on the screen as a spam risk.
I love Pixels don’t get me wrong. Best Android UX in my opinion. But the asking price for what you get compared to other offerings just isn’t justifiable. 

Pixel 9 with a Snapdragon chip would be 🤌🏽
Oh hell yeah! For $300 you can’t go wrong!!
I can run an LLM locally on my iPhone and frequently use it. Attempting the same on a P9 might actually make it explode. The other options I listed can do the same. Pixel can’t. Pixel also can’t do anything that requires mild computing power.

If all you do is text, call and use social media then yeah sure the Pixel is great. But if you are a power user or again do anything that requires raw computing you literally can’t get by with a Pixel. 

I do agree though overall Pixel is the best Android experience
Not the guy you responded to, but of course Pixel has Google apps, which may or may not be considered bloatware. 


But my UNLOCKED S24 has Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft One Drive, and more..


And half of them aren't even removable. OneDrive is deeply integrated into the OS. 


And you can download a different launcher, so the search bar thingy is irrelevant.
With Pixel phones you do not get two of everything like you do on Samsung phones.

That is the bloatware I am referring to.
I got my S25 for $333USD lmao

Realme GT 7 Pro, 699 euros. Snapdragon 8 Elite 6500mAh battery.
I don't hang out here, I check in once in a while to see what's going on.  That's a lot different than people arguing over the most minor differences between phone brands and acting like their choice of phone is superior to others.
Yeah that's true, if someone wants a smaller phone then there's very limited choices. Also if someone is from US then it makes sense to buy flagship phone only due to carrier deals.
I don't know where you live, but in the US, you can get a 13R and a Watch 2R shipped to you for $440, which I did.  And you can get Unlimited service through Verizon's MVNO Visible for $20 a month.  There is no way that in the US you are getting 2 years of service and a S25 for less than $920.  Even if they gave the S25 to you for free, it'd still be more expensive.
The 13R is not the Indian variant. It's the budget worldwide version. With worse SoC, worse cameras, worse battery and fast charging, and lacks wireless charging.
False. All pixels unless they are running graphene OS are vulnerable to cellbrite.
Nope. I've checked in-store.
In hand feel is what matters. I have all 3 devices at home - the P9, S24 and X8. Both the X8 and P9 feel pretty much same in size, but the S24 is significantly lighter. It's the width of these phones that this matters more than the screen - 70.6 vs 72 vs 74. And the curve on the edges which makes them feel smaller in hand. 

The S24 is very sharp, and leaves an imprint on your pinky of you use it to hold the phone up at the bottom. It makes a case mandatory. Which reduces that difference in width even more.

Sorry, but I genuinely care about phone sizes lol. I refuse to use a flagship large phone, and dream of the return of a Pixel 5 sized phone. Fwiw, I used the Zenfone 10 too - incredible battery life and OS, but pathetic camera which is another level below the Galaxy, Find, Pixel series.
Google is working to upgrade Tensor, but the major upgrade will be in next year's phone. Makes sense... Pixel 10. It's a nice milestone. But they're leaving Samsung for TSMC and finally dropping to 3nm. It'll still lag behind but I read the upgrade for the 11 will actually close the gap. 


But for me the G4 is fine. I don't play video games on my phone outside of really simple ones like card games or Head Ball 2. I use my phone for a lot of basic things...internet browsing (not on Firefox), texting, phone calls, dating apps, as an alarm, and the occasional conversation with Irish Gemini...and I haven't had any issues. I guess some websites may not load as fast, but I have the extra second to spare. But bash Google for being lazy. It's a smart phone. And until someone comes up with a new idea to replace the smart phone screen-style device with something completely new, incremental upgrades are just what you get. 
And then there are companies like Honor unfortunately not natively available in the US, but the Magic V3 has been one of the best device experiences I've had since the iPhone 4. Always worried about wrecking the phone, but, so far since day 1 it's been an absolute workhorse and joy to use. 

Samsung and Google have become absolutely stale and way too comfortable at their top positions.
I'm still using a Note 8, and I don't really want to get something new, it'll feel like a downgrade to not have an aux port.  Nothing newer phones have enticee me to be honest.  When I'm crabby, I'll get mad that the back/home/= buttons aren't physical and all i got for losing those was screen burn where the buttons should be.  Of I'm super grumpy I'll grumble about physical keyboards.  I don't want to carry/charge an extra thing around when it's something we had and got taken away.  It's possible! We can do it!  /shakes cane at kids on the lawn.
S25 apparently fixed the shutter lag

https://x.com/fahim_al_mahmud/status/1883186312360137095?s=19
Agree 100%, Switched from a pixel to an s23 and the performance increase combined with the level of customization makes me reluctant to go back to pixel even though I miss the look of photos. If google would stop making the pixel experience iphone lite and stop using garbage cpus/modems I would switch back in a heartbeat.
I just went from 21 ultra to pixel 9 pro and there's no way in hell I'm going back 
The pixel 9 pro beat both the iPhone 16 and the Galaxy S25 in some battery tests. Some results were pretty significant.

One UI sucks. At least to me. More annoying to use than iOS.


Also no network issues for me. Not since the Pixel 7, but the 9 is also an improvement from the 8.
[deleted]
For me the fanboying is because of a couple things. 


1. The Pixel 4a5g was the first non super budget phone I owned and it wowed me. So I stuck with Pixel. 


2. Google's Pixel products and ecosystem are necessary to keep Apple in check. With Google owning Android, they're pure Android os approach, and investment in AI allows for Apple users to switch to Android without too much of a learning curve. It's growing market share...along with multiple government lawsuits....is forcing Apple to open up their locked ecosystem. It'll slowly keep opening up. Maybe I love my Pixel 9 Pro, but want all the features that AirPods have to offer. Or at least a few of them. I actually love the Pixel Buds Pro 2, but would buy a pair of Galaxy Buds no problem. But AirPods are waste on Android. 
It is a phone
So you must think low of people who use those phones, right? 
This is how I feel too.

The new Tensor chip is *fine.* But not at $1,200 for a Pixel 9 Pro XL 256gb model. The S25 Ultra is $1,300 for the same storage.  But the Tensor G4 is on par in CPU performance with a Snapdragon Gen 2 and still lags behind in GPU performance
No kidding. I had a Pixel 6a for like a week. This thing felt worse than OP6, mostly with just heating up like a furnace during heavy tasks. Did not feel faster or better either, camera sucked.
This is exactly how I feel about the cameras. I don't get why Samsung is charging customers more in many cases (especially with the ultra vs the Pro) for a camera that is so significantly worse in every day activities like snapping a photo of your kids or pets. Samsung refuses to fix the quality and has made no strides in this regard. Yeah you trade gaming performance for being able to actually photograph your kids/pets who btw don't ever sit still.... Ever. Don't charge me more money for worse performance or we accept there is a tradeoff.
I mean it's true that it's like a three generation difference but there is the question of 

""What can you accomplish with a phone now that you couldn't accomplish with a phone that's 4 years old.""

So at least in the short term Android is the bottleneck not these chips. 

I mean it's frankly barely makes a difference whether you have a phone with an 865 or an 8g3. And that's like 5 years apart and I genuinely can't think of why One thing I couldn't do on the 865 that I would want to do. 

But pixel will improve when they switch TSMC. The worst part about Pixel phones are all the Samsung internals ironically

But pixel has a lot of benefits over Samsung including no bloat, unlocked bootloader, faster shutter speed, better camera, better voice recording app. ... Way less proprietary stuff. For instance Samsung notes doesn't work on a Windows laptop that isn't a Galaxy book anymore. 


I don't think there's a winner here. Both of these companies are engaging in pretty anti-consumer s***. I think Pixel deserved a little more of a benefit of the doubt with the Pixel 6 and 7 when they were undercutting Samsung's pricing considerably. The Pixel 7 pro for instance was a solid $400 cheaper than the s22 ultra and $100 cheaper than the s22 Plus which only had a 1080p screen. 


But with the price increases at this point oneplus is all of a sudden the only one that looks impressive in the US market
The elite certainly will. Better process node and better design. The G4 is better than the G3 but it's still not near a snapdragon.
Easily unlockable bootloader. For me the #1 selling point of pixel devices. Full control over your hardware.
I got my pixel 9 pro for 300 from mint mobile, it vastly out performs my s21 ultra 
There is not, there is however a real problem that Samsung phones are terrible at capturing moving objects, a problem Pixel has solved long ago  
https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-galaxy-s23-ultra-finally-better-at-taking-photos-of-moving-objects
You can tell by downvotes.
Which Pixel do you have ? I have a Pixel 7 Pro, and I live in India where the whole year is hot basically. I have never had this issue, even when driving for prolonged periods under intense sun in the car. From what I understand, Pixel 9 is leagues better than the 7 in terms of battery efficiency and heat management.
Tbf, Samsung builds the Google Tensors. Qualcomm, Mediatek and Samsung has been designing chips for so long while Google only started in 2021.
It's definitely a weak spot but it's ironically because they're using Samsung internals. And they've already contracted TSMC to make the new ones while Samsung is now having to move mediatek. So it's going to be funny when Samsung fans have to turn around and say performance doesn't matter in a couple years. 

But anyways, the reason I'm not so infatuated with performances cuz the bottleneck is Android. Can run any game at their maximum frame rates with an 865 chip. What exactly do the newer chips enable you to do that you couldn't do with an older chip? 


The only reason it's an issue in my opinion is thermal and battery performance. But when the Pixel 6 came out they were competing against the 888 which was also fabricated by Samsung and a complete s*** show. Pixel 7 pro came out it was competing against 8g1... Also fabricated by Samsung and also a complete s*** show. 


So honestly the performance doesn't bother me what bothers me is the constant price increases, the stupid AI b*******.

But you get an unlocked bootloader and a much better beta program and a much better camera. 

I just I don't know why people are so solely focused on the performance of the chip when Android OS is such that the performance of the chip doesn't really matter. 


I mean this is the same with iPhones. There's functionally no noticeable difference between using the a16 versus the a13. Not to the end user. Where it matters I suppose is the long-term arc of development but for the short-term user it means almost nothing.
I am not commenting on the SoC. My comment was around how many people would actually notice it. Most people buy a flagship for good photos. Last I checked, the Pixel does a lot better for photos, especially for children and pets (two very common use cases for a lot of people). 

Not saying Google should not improve (they should), but the reality is that marketing and promotions make a far bigger impact on sales than the SoC which 90% don't care about.
You were meant to say Exynos 5300 modem which killed Tensor G1 - G3. Exynos 5400 modem performs equally as good on the Pixel 9. Modem performance is flawless with Pixel 9 and battery life is still better than the regular S25 despite the mAh difference which is compensated for underwhelming CPU performance.
Pretending 70% of your battery doesn't go to powering the screen.
More power to take blurry photos of my pets? Context matters here.
Well this is a modern format and uploading it to a video site would transcode the hell out of it so....
Why would anyone do that?
Never played the game, but every time people quote that games FPS like it's something everyone does all the time.
how do you feel about oneplus/oppo
It's still winning a lot of awards and comparisons all the time. There are better specs, but for a point & shoot camera, results and reliability will always be favored over numbers in a spec sheet.
Right and honestly like some people might not care about the throttling if they don't use high performance software and the like. In which case maybe you're happy about the throttling. But I would argue there should be a high performance mode in the settings at least and that people should be aware that they're battery life is improved because of throttling. 

It's like when Samsung removed their high performance mode and started getting praised for increased battery life. 

Yeah but you're paying for that increase battery life in diminished performance. If that's okay with you you might want to seriously consider looking into mid-range devices and saving yourself money. 

Not necessarily maybe you want the flagship because of the camera or the design or the longer updates but I do agree that how something is achieved can matter. 

It doesn't matter to everybody but it's certainly does in the throttling example you listed. 

But I don't necessarily care if the sensor is outdated. I don't even care if the chip is outdated. Frankly I actually think 8g2 is a better trip than 8g3 and 8g4 (whatever it's called now) because when you see honest testing of the better you find out that both of those require more power on their sustained load.

That's why we're seeing so many bigger batteries this year although the difference was not very drastic 8g3 

Likewise I thought the 865 chip was way better than 888 8g1.
Many people have a tendency to get their phone with their phone plan and they don't usually wanna pay a lot for a phone upfront, so they take whatever is $5/mo or ""free"" and that tends to be a phone whether samsung, google, apple or other that has 128GB of storage.

I don't believe Samsung is waiting for Apple. They are both very rich companies and apart from that, mostly the same shareholders.

If people are willing to pay, why would shareholders change it?
My old Galaxy Note 9 has 128GB of storage and when I was using it as my main phone I had my music on it, taking up about 60-70GB. My new phone Galaxy S21 Ultra has 256GB. If my Note 9 didn't have an SD card I'd be severely lacking in the storage depot considering I also store hundreds of gigs worth of videos and movies on the SD card. If you stream more than you store than perhaps 128GB is plenty for you. :)
Just pay for our cloud storage bro
That's less the fault of the hardware and more about hardware.

That's more or less the fault of the hardware then? Hehe
And we STILL have [people ITT who say ""just use manual""](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1iadobz/samsung_galaxy_s25_vs_google_pixel_9_you_cant_go/m9cwk3w/?context=10) like it resolves Samsung's shitty camera software.
Well I don't think I would say everything. I mean many things particularly having the desktop mode and better performance. 

But the pixel has much better stuff for like call screening, a much better recorder app. Much quicker updates, a much more interesting beta program. Doesn't use a horizontal app drawer, it's much easier to move apps to the home screen (Samsung forces you to click long press find app and then once again move it).

Also pixels have unlocked bootloaders and most Samsungs do not 

All of that said, The pixel launcher can be very disappointing because you can't remove that damn widget or even change the default search option in. You can't remove the attic alliance so your main homepage is wildly nerfed in how you can manipulate it. 

Thankfully in both cases I'll usually switch to a third party launcher. 

Also Samsung has 60 GB of system storage instead of like 15. The updates are faster in terms of time it takes to accomplish with Samsung but you can't use the phone while it's updating. 

until this year the pixel was also a much better value proposition in terms of price where the pixel 7 pro for instance was $400 less than the s22 ultra and it started with 12 GB of RAM instead of 8 


But frankly both companies have pissed me off in a lot of ways lately.

For instance Pixel finally did add a manual mode to their camera but then don't actually let you use the full resolution of the camera. They just made an update that broke the Pixel 4a for a lot of people and only gave them two days notice and 50 bucks and even then you need to sign up for a financial services company that will charge you 30 bucks a year to use just to get the 50 bucks.
For a while there was an issue with gestures navigation and any other launcher, not sure if that was fixed but I'd assume so? The pixel launcher is horrible and buggy imo
This is a very limited perspective, maybe for YOU launchers are a major selling point. You may be shocked to learn that there are billions of folks who buy a cellphone with other priorities in mind.
Another clown who doesnt know every launcher has been broken since android 13?
One of the most inaccurate things parroted on this sub.

I've used Nova and Niagra on multiple pixels and two Galaxy devices.  Not only nor ""extremely buggy"", I haven't experienced any bugs.
I switch between Lawnchair and Niagara; haven't come across any bugs. 

Also that doesn't negate the fact that the bar isn't permanent.
Huh? How is faster buggy?
I've been using nova launcher for at least 3 phones now. Standard experience in all of them.
I heard good lock isn't working on the s25 yet. Is that true?
Not being able to hide the navigation bar is a deal breaker for me. It literally had no purpose other than to take up a small amount of screen space. It's not like I'm going to forget where the gesture location is.
>or square or those childish shape Samsung uses that I don't even know the name.

[Squircle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squircle)
I still do that. 

Most launchers will have a ""legacy"" icon option.
It’s only a minority here that keeps reigniting ancient advice
Long click the notification and open the apps permissions page then deselect the app from being able to send notifications of that type. 

And they all do have a promotions notification option somewhere in settings. Almost all the default apps can be uninstalled or at least disabled. It's stupid that it's there in the first place but I haven't gotten a promotional notification in years on my S21.
I recently switched to iOS to check what the other side is doing, and nowadays you can uninstall all the preloaded Apple apps in the EU. Even Apple is less bloated nowadays.
Bad is relatively. If you need professional pictures every phone is bad, if your photos will end in the cloud to never been seen again, it really matters?

I think every phone camera is just a great scanner for documents.I personally would be happy with old cameras paired with new processors for cheap.
Oh yea I love OneUI. I went to iPhone in 2023, but with RCS I’m probably going back. Don’t care about green bubbles, but 99% of my family and friends have iPhone, and the compressed photo and video quality was dreadful. I had a lot of my phone automated with the Bixby routines and I miss it!!
> Silicone carbon batteries are just becoming the norm even though phones have had them for a year or so now? Honor used it last Jan already. All phones released, and upcoming by every other brand aside from Samsung and google are using silicone carbon.




Tho it does feel like the ""exclusivity deal"" Honor had with their silicon carbon battery manufacturer only ended relatively recently; the second ever brand to sell phones with silicon carbon batteries was Vivo in April 2024 (Vivo X Fold3 series & iQOO Z9 series)

> All phones released, and upcoming by every other brand aside from Samsung and google are using silicone carbon.

So buy one of those phones instead? That's the whole point of Android, choice. Instead of bitching about what the latest phone doesn't have you can just go and buy the phone that does have it.
Where is it written that Samsung has to be first adopting new tech?  I think they're probably going to take their time with a new battery before rolling it out given their past history with a certain phone wanting to explode.
They shoud be. I'm surprised at how much they give. I was never gonna buy a Honor phone myself but if i need to buy one quick for someone im buying any new honor midrange just for the value proposition alone
And? You can still fit a 5000 mah battery in a 6.2"" screen phone. And 6.2"" isn't compact. 

That also doesn't forgive that it only has 128 GB of storage to start either when my phone has 256 GB and a SD card slot.
Why is 23 better than 24?
I literally just traded in a 3 year s22u and got an s25u plus buds3 pro for like $700 AUD. The pre-order discounts make it easily cheaper than any other flagship phone, including last year's model.
I haven't had as much luck with them in the past for this. I also have work partners who use Saumsung who get far more than me and I'm stuck with them for a 12 hr shift. I know its better than when I work with people with iPhones though, but I only get maybe 1-2 that get through a month.
Every app that is forced upon you and can't be uninstalled can be potential bloatware for someone. Google apps can't be removed and just because they are from Google doesn't mean I want them. I only use Maps and Photos from Google and nothing else. Yet I can't uninstall Chrome, YouTube, Gmail etc.
My only point is that you can say one phone has bloatware and the other doesn't when the second one can uninstall every app you don't want to use. Which is not the case with the Pixel as well as Samsung.
Just keep the better out of the two for example samsung internet is way more op than chrome, notes, find my, samsung keyboard, etc
And from the ""two of everything"" I uninstall Google variant and keep Samsung one. So from my point of view the unnecessary apps are Google's.
Everyone is free to use whichever app they want but  Google, Samsung or Microsoft apps can equally be bloatware or useful apps.
And Google shouldn't get a free pass for forcing down their apps just because they own Android.
Yeah, the extra Google apps are bloatware.
Doesn’t make the S25 necessarily cheaper. You can also get deals on the Pixel.
What did you trade in?
52% of 6500 is around 3400mAh. Thats still less than 4000mAh and also the Realme has a bigger display so higher power consumption. Pretty sure the S25 will be able to do between 7 to 8 hours which is what the average user expects.
Who could possibly have expected people to be discussing the intricacies of Android phones on /r/android?
Germany. It's 695€ at the cheapest online retailer and 749€ at OnePlus (with an additional 50€ voucher if you do a trade in and you get a free case).

Meanwhile you can get an S25 alongside a 2-year contract (30GB 5G, which is a pretty decent plan by German standards) for a total of 623€ (device + service). The plan alone is worth at least 240€, maybe even a bit more. Discounts with plans for OnePlus are considerably worse, starting at around 740€ total.

So yeah, it can depend heavily on where you live and the timing of the offers. To be fair, I did a bit of research and there was an offer earlier this month for the 13R plus the Watch 2R for around 740€ (minus 50€ bonus if you trade in a device minus 10% if you're a student).
No wireless charging is a deal breaker. It's too damn convenient to give up
Noone's safe against a spy org with extensive government involvement, bottomless funds, and zero accountability.

""Only iOS and graphene remain undefeated"" lmao.
Cool, good to know. Samsung stills strong for me.
Camera in Samsung is so bad...I don't even consider anymore...it's a blurry festival
The G4 is fine for you because you're the kind of user that would benefit fine with a midrange $300-500 smartphone.

And that's fine. But if that's all you expect, then I'm not sure what the point is of buying a premium priced phone.
>Google is working to upgrade Tensor, but the major upgrade will be in next year's phone.

We've been hearing this from G since their first Tensor phone.
The fact those photos are in bright daylight conditions don't mean much. We need to see examples in darker conditions.
This makes me excited. Moving from S23U to the S25U and I recently got a kitten.
I'd like to believe but that guy is a Samsung mobile creator and when people in his comments section mentioned those were very favorable lighting and motion conditions that even the S24U could handle this guy became irate and fanboyish. 

Multiple reviewers have said the shutter lag is improved but not fixed. [This reviewer for example showcases the difference between an iPhone 16 Pro Max and the S25U](https://youtu.be/RFYTJ0oyALk?si=b3RK1a-LAud0msIR&t=607). In less favorable conditions the iPhone still took a good picture of a moving person, while the S25U gave him a blurred mess.
What are you even talking about? If you shoot with the 50MP camera, the lag it takes before it takes the photo is ridiculous. I'm pretty sure OneUI doesn't have it this bad, and I know for a fact iPhone doesn't at all. Makes me regret switching to the 9 Pro XL.
You and 5 other people care a lot about that
??
> on par in CPU performance with a Snapdragon Gen 2 

More like the 8+ gen 1, in fact it performs worse than it lol. It's just pathetic and embarrassing atp.
But the Galaxy S25 Ultra is ugly. 
Samsung isnt shipping 4 generation old hardware tech u just yapping
pixel phones are known for  limited customisation and limited features so how is it full control?

Unlocking bootloader voids your warranty and it doesn't make sense to install custom rom in a phone that's going to get more 4-5yrs update.
You still cant do shit on the toy os that is android
I would hope so. The P9P came out this year and the S21U in 2021.
This is blown out of proportion.
[deleted]
Regular 7 and 8.

I ordered S25 Ultra now, so it will be fun to see how that behaves while Android Auto, and overall. I can definitely feel some stutters now on my 7 especially.

EDIT: Out of curiosity, what is the battery life on yours while using android auto? My car has wireless AA, and literally I have to have it plugged in because otherwise in 1hr 30 min it will be down to 20% from full

And to add to this, i really like my 7, bought it new for ~500 euros, which i feel is the right price for the phone. Google, especially with the 9 series now tries to sell them for premium price, which is absolutely bonkers, s24/s25 is cheaper than that, much more powerful and efficient, as well as not having features geo locked like Pixels have..
My pixel 9 pro crushes everything I throw at it, hot or cold. 
I have a pixel 9 pro xl. Great phone, no issues whatsoever and I don't need any more performance. But, its still embarrassing and we should expect better, especially of google.
I would not confidently say flawless. There are still modem issues with no clear way of telling what is causing it.
Ah, another pixel fanboy justifying their expensive yet midrange specs. Seriously, if the tensor os that good, then any midranged-priced phone will be too.
Screens have gotten vastly more efficient over the years. Unlike chips, whose workload increases every year, a screen only needs to be so large and so bright before people are completely satisfied.


I have the numbers to back it up too. On my Pixel 8, the screen usually uses 10-20% of my battery. The cellular modem just about always uses more battery if I'm not on Wifi.
Lol where did u even get that number from? Battery usage of the screen depends a multiple factors like the refresh rate, content being viewed, brightness level etc. How can you just place an arbitrary number on it?
[deleted]
Youd rather want a low quality noisy greyed out mess that pixels produce compared to samsung then
Why would anyone send a video to someone?  Like a million reasons?  If you don't have friends or family I could understand being bewildered though.
""To flex on all the non-snapdragon nerds, duh""
Definitely are improving at much faster pace compared to Samsung. They remind me of how Huawei was before the US ban. If they focus more in western markets and Samsung continue being this lazy/sloppy they will overthrow Samsung from the top spot. If I ever switch from Samsung I will either buy Oneplus, Xiaomi or Oppo phone next.
Great hardware, but both Google and Samsung have 7 year software support now and that means a lot to me.

If they had at least 4 years of support, they would be very tempting.  

At this point, I expect to be able to keep a phone for quite a long time before needing an upgrade.
Great hardware at very competitive prices, but everywhere I go I see past and present One Plus owners warn that the software isn't as bulletproof compared to its competitors and that customer service at least in the US still also lags behind its competitors. 

I want to give the One Plus 13 a try but I'm worried about falling for the ""grass is always greener on the other side""
Of course they're waiting for apple. They didn't remove the headphone jack or the charger in the box until Apple did it. 

People aren't willing to pay for extras unless they see apple do it because apple is thought of as an innovative tech company and their contributions as useful by default, even if they aren't useful and even if they weren't the first one to introduce it. But that doesn't change the expectation.
They wait on Apple to make the move with pretty much everything. The whole industry does. 

You highlighted another problem with 128GB being base storage. Don't know how it is in the US, but in Europe most carriers stock the lowest capacity and don't offer higher storage options. This means if somebody wants to go with a carrier plan, they are stuck with 128GB.
I never stream music to my phone, and my phone isn't my primary repository for music. It also isn't the primary listening device.
Hahaha autocorrect 🙄
Why can't it be about the hardware? Didn't Samsung already show off this feature as well on stage, but then Samsung Electronics never decided to enable the feature in software?
Software experience in Pixel has been subpar, at least in my use case. Even today I came across a bug where pixel settings was not allowing me to change wallpapers. And like you said, you can't even remove the widget.

 Also, the amount of space is wasted on the home screen is just mind boggling. At least give the option to adjust grid sizes but nope. 

The camera performance is excellent in Pixel but then the UI? It feels like that UI was developed by a uni fresher making something for his HCI101 project. It's so bad, if you need to adjust exposure you have to press 3 buttons to adjust exposure lol. In early pixels it was just a simple intuitive slide, similar to how iOS camera interface is. But now it's just garbage, don't know how something like that gets approval from Google of all company. I expect polished software experience from a mega corp like Google. But somehow a major hardware company like Samsung makes better software, OneUI actually felt more polished last time I used and no wonder Pixel devices are a niche today. Until they get their shit together they aren't catching up to Samsung or other big timers anytime soon.
Yeah at least on OnePlus phones, there is really bad latency and issues when going back to the home screen using something like Nova Launcher.
It's always a major selling point when the consumer can personalize things to their own liking. 

What's the alternative? Not being able to and losing a sale?

Having the option available hurts no one and makes it objectively better.
I mean there are occasional bugs related to third party launchers on newer versions of Android. It's bad enough that third party launcher developers including the ones you listed all jointly wrote a letter asking Android to fix these things. 

All of that said I find him to be barely noticeable if at all noticeable. It's not like Android 10 when sometimes jesters would break entirely with third party launchers. 

And even then that was resolved by just turning button control on and then turning gestures back on. 

But yes if I'm using a Samsung phone or a Pixel phone 2025 I'm changing to a third party launcher for 80% of my use. 


So I do think the complaints are wildly exaggerated at times but they certainly exist since Niagara launchers developers have now organized to try to have them fixed 

I could find the link to the letter if you want but you could probably just start third party launcher developers/write letter to Google.
Back when I had the Nexus 5x, they stopped bugfixing the Google Now launcher before support ended, leaving a few half baked features. So I switched to the Microsoft (previously Arrow) launcher.  

Liked it so much I kept using it from day one when I got my Pixel 2 until I replaced it with this pixel 9.  

I tried stock for a few days this time but switched again in the end.  

Been using full gesture nav the whole time it was available and never had any problems or bugs due to the launcher.  

To be fair, the Xiaomi my wife had for a time had lag problems with it, but that thing didn't run particularly well with anything. Pixels been fine though.
I'm hoping this is fixed, but sometimes on nova when I go home with gestures, I just get an empty home screen. This is on a pixel 8. Anyone else have this issue?
Do you use it with gestures?
Third party launchers are still not fully compatible with gestures. There's always a short delay after closing an app, during which the screen is non responsive. It's a deal breaker for me
""opinion is wrong because I didn't experience anything"" is pulled right out your ass to prove a point. Stick it down your throat instead and admit that 3rd party launchers don't provide the same fluidity as stock without rooting. If this wasn't a problem, there wouldn't be modules to fix it
There was an issue once where gestures didn't fully work in Nova on Pixel. But seems it is fixed already?

How do I get lawnchair to work? I downloaded it from the play store but that doesn't seem to be the way to do it, as that didn't do anything for me, or maybe I just don't get how the lawnchair launcher works. Any advice?
There's a bug for my where my launcher freezes
custom roms are fine, my moto freezes up a lot sometimes, have heard same about scamsung
They update goodlock with each new one ui release
Well if you get me an S25 I'll try it out for you 😅
Apple has full control over iOS and pre-installed third party software (at least in the states regarding carrier software). They’ve never been considered bloated compared to android
I should have explained myself better, the average user will be so much happier with a pixel camera, point and shoot and you are satisfied. Samsung cameras produce so many blurry photos.
Europe is on such a different reality lol. No one uses iMessage. All whatsapp. The images suck there too though.

I literally said I'm invested in the ecosystem and I use heaps of the Samsung exclusive features, I use the Spen daily?

I don't just want the battery.
Can you show me a phone with 5000 mAh battery weighing 162 grams, 7.2mm thick or less?
Because it has a Snapdragon. S24 has Exynos.
I get a few more than your 1-2 per month but not even 1-2 per week. I go weeks without a single spam call. I used to get more, but as I reported them, it has gotten better over time. Samsung's has to be trained a bit outside the most common spam callers. I went to another phone between Samsung phone upgrades and got way more spam calls.
You can disable chrome, YouTube, Gmail and the vast majority of other Google apps on a Pixel, including stuff like the contacts app and the calendar.

You can't uninstall them because they're part of the system installation so a user doesn't have the rights to do so, as simple as that. If you disable them they're effectively impossible to access and the only difference from having them uninstalled is that they still use space on disk, but it's an extremely minor thing.
My issue was how forced some apps were.  Samsung's password manager constantly firing notifications et al.
Better would be just getting one and not two.  That is the problem with Samsung phones.

iPhone and Pixels you just get one of each thing.  Much better user experience.
and Samsung gets a free pass for agreeing to include it and cheapen the out of the box experience, right of course
In my experience Google stuff tends to be better than Samsung.
Pixel historically never had deals as insane
Nothing. I'm not sending in a trade-in.
And my old Nokia E72 could do 5 days on a 1200mAh battery,

The point is that they are selling phones which are supposed to be the best android has to offer, the pixel is around 3 generations behind in CPU and the galaxy is around 2 generations behind on battery.

And both are more expensive than the phone I took the stats from.
They've been cracked also.  Only iOS and graphene remain undefeated. Tells you a lot about who really offers security lol
Yeah, that Twitter guy is a Samsung mobile content creator, and [other reviewers like this guy for example showcase the difference between an iPhone 16 Pro Max and the S25U](https://youtu.be/RFYTJ0oyALk?si=b3RK1a-LAud0msIR&t=607). In less favorable conditions the iPhone still took a good picture of a moving person, while the S25U gave him a blurred mess.
Battery size of a 4 yerar old phone, cameras are 2-3 years old, charging speed 4 years old, ram 3-4 years old...

Sounds like they kind of are.
Eeeehhhh they kind of are.

I guess if we want to be technical, they did downgrade their zoom lens and charge more for it. So there is that, they deserve credit for that.
It is full control because Google makes it easy to unlock the bootloader and relock it. 

Unlocking your bootloader will not void your warranty as you can relock your bootloader easily. You will only void your warranty if you brick your device because of your own incompetence. 

By having this option you can for example install GrapheneOS, degoogling your phone, making it more private and secure.
Lol man it's not, I mostly love my s24+ but my wife's iPhone 13 pro still smokes it on pics of our 1 year old when she isn't sitting still (which is most of the time).
Its not  
I had to grab my friends Pixel 7a to get any usable photos of our go kart session, my S23 just wasn't up to the task
Just use what you want man. They are all fast and reliable these days. 


Why do you care so much what others use ?
I did hear the regular 7 had pretty bad battery life. My 7 Pro with AA wireless lasts 4-5 hours before it reaches its 20s. It's not amazing, but that's more than enough, since I can then plug it in the car. And yes, the P7 series was significantly less priced compared to its Samsung and Apple counterparts which made it a vfm purchase imo.
The whole article is about choosing the two phones. The whole point is that power is not the only thing people want.
There's no use speaking to you or this hivemind of a group which can't see beyond processors and specs. Good luck buddy.
Don't have the 13 myself but I am using the 12R. It's honestly not bad. ColorOS/OxygenOS might need a little getting used to but really it's not bad at all. 

Will say though, seems like all the Chinese manufacturers are making their UI be as close to iOS' UI as possible. Why? I don't know. But it's still okay in my book, it's fast/smooth, clean, and responsive.
As a YouTuber once said, Samsung is the Korean Apple
Both of those statements suck as they are true
Coz even on Samsung hardware if you use other softwares like gcam for example you'll get much better results.
I would bet money that less than 50% of Android users know what a launcher is.
Fair enough.  I remember issues with my Pixel 4 and Nova, but they seemed short lived.   

Anyone who claims at this time that 3rd party launchers are ""extremely buggy"" are misinformed however.
Yes, exclusively.
There's absolutely zero delay in gestures on my S23 using Nova.
Yes this is true and it's evidenced by the fact that Niagara and Nova and others wrote a letter to Google recently asking for access to it. 

All of that said from the user experience I do not notice any complaints with it. I do recall with Android 10 sometimes The gestures would break on some devices but on newer models whatever limitations they have to the animations I do not notice. 

Maybe it's bc I turn animations down to .5

Whatever the limitations are I find Nova launcher to be way better than both the home screen for the Pixel or the one UI. Like you can't customize gestures on those or resize the grid beyond a few presets.

Pixel launcher is probably the most obnoxious in terms of not being able to remove the widgets but Samsung has the worst app drawer in the game at least out of all the phones I've used. And the vertical app drawer available in good lock is not good either.

I mean but hey we all have our own use cases and preferences so I do not doubt that the limitations to access to the animations isn't a hassle for some users and developers
""Opinion is wrong""

So it's their *opinion*?  There's either bugs or there isn't.  It's not an opinion, and as you can see by most of the responses I'm not the only one who uses a 3rd party launcher without being ""extremely laggy"".

You're quite angry about this.
You have to go into your android settings and set the default launcher to Lawnchair. Search default in your settings and you should find it.

Then you can edit the launcher to your heart's content.
If that's happening in Nova launcher that's because they were bought out by branch analytics. They chucked the original dev team and they haven't fixed or added anything in the app in years. 

Used Nova launcher for years and it was bug free up until some newer android updates started making it freeze up every so often and Nova's just been ""tough stuff we don't care 🤷‍♂️"" about it.
Been using Niagara launcher on my s21fe and note 9 before that for many years. No issues
When you setup your iPhone, they come with all the Apple apps preinstalled. 

Things I considered bloat were Safari because no adblock, so i swapped to Brave. Apple Maps inferior to Google Maps. I deleted the Journal app and if you don't own a Apple watch the Watch app is useless as well. Facetime is also useless for me because I use Signal/Threema for communication.

Thanks to EU regulation I can delete the useless apps that take space. It should be the norm for every device.
Yes I work with a lot of students and adults from all over and they all use WhatsApp. I wish it was more common in the US.
Yeah, I once bought an Iphone and was kinda hyped to use imessage, of all my contacts only my therapist had it enabled but she still didn't use it lmao.

Now I'm experiencing the same with RCS, except in this case many more people have it enabled. They still use Whatsapp, god damn it.

Weight and thickness are a choice. They chose that instead of battery, people are perfectly free to criticize them for that choice. 

Sony Xperia 10 IV fits everything but the thickness requirement (which is a silly requirement of course a phone with more battery will be thicker and 99.9% of people won't care).
It seems to be the same for Samsung? You can disable them or remove them ADB.
Same with Samsung apps. And any app can be disabled with ADB, even system apps. That doesn't add anything on the topic.
You can't uninstall them because they're part of the system installation so a user doesn't have the rights to do so, as simple as that.


That's true for any bloatwire and should not be a justification don't you think?
Idk man. I prefer having choices and then striking out the unwanted
That's just Your opinion. And in no way objective fact.
Just how it's My opinion that Google makes shitty apps.
That's your opinion mate. Even as I am typing on a pixel, I use samsung apps and some of them are really good. Samsung browser for instance is amazing.
they are inconsistent ugly grey LCD panel like interfaces with   limited features which makes them inferior and useless. Now why do you think they are tend to be better? it's history now they were good before 2017-18.
Wait, really? I have read about FBI breaking into the iOS from these terrorists iPhones.
That described pixel better especially with a 4 gen old soc and an even older camera hardware.
buy google phone to degoogle it for privacy and they will still manage to steal data whenever you are connected to the internet. So, why don't you turn it off for better privacy.
It's possible to get decent pictures with a steady hand and a lotta tweaks to the setting. It is, blown out of proportion, I did not say it was a non-issue.
For the years I carried a z fold I always brought a pixel with me just for the camera. Too many shots came out blurry on the Samsung.
Blown so out of proportion that samsung still continues to sell more than pixel by a huge margin lol no one cares
Switch to pro mode and use the correct shutter speed. 

I get it though, Google camera software has been ahead of everyone for a long time. And Sony should have been blowing everyone out of the water with their better camera hardware but they screw it up with awful software
Pixel performance is not reliable. 

Samsung cameras are not reliable.
Premium price premium expectations
Yeah I definitely would've bought a OP 13 if I didn't already have a S23 Ultra or if OP offered a higher trade in. I bought a 10T for my dad's birthday a while back and he has been very happy with it. 

Maybe next year I'll consider the OP 14 or if the OP13 goes on sale
It’s probably closer to 1%. There are 3-4 billion active Android users worldwide. The Google Play Store displays “50M+ Downloads” in the lifetime of Nova Launcher, the most popular third-party launcher.
Yes there is, when closing an app you need to wait for the animation to finish before you can scroll or open another app. It's subtle but I don't like it
I haven't owned a Samsung phone, but I have heard that their flavor of OS handles third-party launchers way better. It's awful on Pixels though.

EDIT: For my own sanity, I am not going to argue with the idiots who think Pixels don't have issues with third-party launchers. They absolutely do. Just because you're too blind to notice doesn't mean your phone is fine. I am just going to downvote these comments and move on, because their blindness is not relevant to any discussion here.
I understand that it's not a big issue for some people but I'm not sure why I'm getting downvoted
It isn't unique to Nova. It happens on multiple different launchers. I use Microsoft Launcher.

https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1gwf6vk/has_google_finally_fixed_the_third_party_launcher/
so older androids ? its broken in new versions
> They chose that instead of battery, people are perfectly free to criticize them for that choice. 

""I can criticize people for not having the same preferences as me"". OK.
Yes, it's absolutely true for all system apps.

The only difference is whether they can be disabled ""cleanly"". For example the phone app can't be disabled on a Pixel, I don't know what it's like for other vendors.
You still have choice.   You just go get what you want.  

But a lot of people are not like that and just want the phone to come as they would use.

Samsung it is a bit of a mess as you get duplicates.  Just not as good of a user experience as you get with iPhones and Pixels.
Yeah older versions generally get cracked, but it's like way behind,  the newest iPhone it can break is a 12 running iOS 16 or lower. Where as it can currently break any current android device that isn't running graphene.
The Pixel 9 series much better camera hardware than the S25 and S25+ lol
I am afraid your thinking is not really open-minded. I do not think this will be a productive conversation.
Lol dude yes the 0.01% of owners who consider themselves dedicated Samsung Galaxy photographers willing to adjust iso in pro mode can get a decent pic if they have 10 seconds to do so. Or, my wife can just use her 3 year old iPhone in sub-par lighting and get a great pic of our baby.

I didn't want to believe it, but the disparity is pretty fucking ridiculous.
User: Pixels take more usable pictures than Samsungs

You: Samsung outsells Google  
Also you: ""lol no one cares""

*Narrator*: You do care *a lot* about defending Samsung

FOR

FREE
I'd definitely agree with that number, but I wouldn't make bets on it lol
There's absolutely zero delay in gestures on my S23 using Nova.
Pixel 7 pro, pixel 8 pro and now pixel 9 pro xl, Nova launcher, latest beta, zero issues across all of them... Never had, in fact the issues I have had are all related to it being a pixel, not because of the launcher, since I've had those without using any launcher...
I use a third party launcher on pixels and I find it to be no problem at all. Some people must be really sensitive to the animations or something because I never have any (noticeable) bugs on third party launchers with pixels or with Samsung for that matter. Outside of Android 10.

Maybe it's b. I turn animations down to .5 anyways but to me I don't notice it at

I'm not saying they don't exist, I know newer versions of Android do restrict the launcher's ability to have access to certain APIs. But to me Nova launcher is a great experience on a pixel.  Way better than the stock launcher. And I would say the same thing about Samsung. 

Although I've heard the exact opposite thing you did in fact I explicitly read an article that explained why Nova launcher works better on pixels than it does on Samsung. 

But in both cases, whatever bugs and limitations exist, I find third party launchers like Nova to be way better than one UI or the pixel home screen.

But I do know all of these third party launchers are organizing to try to get more access to animations and other things that they cannot control. So I do think Android could be more hospitable to launchers I just know from my user experience then they are way superior to the pixel launcher or one UI. 

Like the fact that you can't customize launchers on either of the stock launchers right there is reason enough for me to switch to Nova. 

Double tapping for my remote control or swiping up and down on icons for shortcuts should be available on every these devices.
I've been using Nova for over a decade... What is ""broken"" for custom launchers? You keep saying the same thing but don't provide any examples or proof.
S21fe still gets updates
Pixel 8 Pro running A16Beta. Nothing, yet.
I don't know... 

I came from a Pixel 6 & 7, I'm well aware of the Pixel ecosystem. I didn't find the extra 10 mins it took me to disable unneeded Samsung apps as a bad thing. I had to disable some Google apps too like Chrome, but I didn't think much of it either. 

Nowadays I find myself using the Samsung Gallery app far more than Google Photos and Goodlock adds a lot of neat customization that Pixel lacks. I don't see this as bloatware, but as features I can choose and drop. In the same way I didn't see the barebones Pixel environment as a lack of features initially but just a different take on OS.
Here is a video of me on pixel 9 pro xl attempting to swipe up and bring up the Nova home screen context menu. It has a ~10% success rate. Gestures on pixel and 3rd party launchers are buggy af. They weren't on my s22u

https://imgur.com/a/YJbPGj5
custom launchers dont give their own app switcher, so while the homepage and ui is your launcher, app switching comes from default launcher which is causing issues. 

In both moto and samsung ( perosnal experience ) , many times launcher just freezes when i try to switch between apps.

as for proof, many launcher devs have already complained about it , and filed a bug
Swipe up as you would otherwise open the app drawer? You're overwriting the original behavior with another one in nova? Not taking a dig, just trying to understand what you were trying to do
In Nova you can hit the home screen button twice or perform the go home gesture if you're already on the home screen. This brings up a smart context menu. 

It's not quite the same as swiping up to open the app drawer. It's just doing the home action again while you're already there. 

You can also double tap the home screen to open it. The buggy part is that on pixel 9 the go home gesture is huge. You can swipe up from the bottom and slide it up to around 15% of the screen to go home. On pixel, you have to stop your up swipe at like 2% to get the Nova action to register. On my s22u there was no disconnect. As long as you did a go home gesture on the home screen it worked.
I see, so yes, it's what I was thinking, about the gestures are prolly canceling each other out, I guess me not having issues is because I try to not have overlapping gestures, even though it should work",2025-01-26 12:47:23,327,424,https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-google-pixel-9/
Android,"Google rolls out new accessibility features for Android, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25","Alongside updates to [Gemini](https://www.androidfaithful.com/gemini-at-galaxy-unpacked-25/) and [Circle to Search](https://www.androidfaithful.com/circle-to-search-at-galaxy-unpacked-25/), Google also unveiled new accessibility features coming to select Android devices, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25 series.

## Hearing aid support over Bluetooth LE Audio

For starters, Google says that it's launching LE Audio compatibility on the Galaxy S25, enabling hands-free calling and a low-latency connection to [GN ReSound](https://www.resound.com/en-us/) and [Oticon Intent](https://www.oticon.com/) hearing aids. Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. 

For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.

While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.

Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. 

## Support for braille displays that use HID

For people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.

In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices.

Comments:
It's not as flashy, but I love this stuff. I have hearing loss and Apple has simply been the *only* game in town when it comes to deliberate accommodations and thoughtful changes. Android doesn't even allow audio adjustment via an audiogram like iOS does. 

  
These are good steps! Thanks for sharing. I probably would've never heard about this given all the other announcements.
LE Audio is actually already available on some Android devices, staring with the Pixel 7 and Samsung S23 (FE not included for 23, but 24 FE does have it).
Correct, but this is about new features for managing hearing aids that connect to your phone via LE Audio. Those new features are only available on the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 for now.
Ah I see. I wonder if it'll finely bring it more in line with Apple's MFi menu. I'll be downloading the update soon. Thanks for posting.",2025-01-22 18:04:19,49,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1i7hgbd/google_rolls_out_new_accessibility_features_for/
Android,"Gemini is getting smarter with apps, YouTube videos, and your camera","Samsung is one of the best-selling Android smartphone brands, so it's no surprise that Google works closely with them. During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.

## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos

[Gemini Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I/O 2024.

Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.

These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.

Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.

## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app

[Project Astra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.

Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.

## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and services

Although Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.

Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.

Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.

## New Gemini extensions for Samsung apps

Google also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder. These four apps are exclusive to Samsung devices, and their extensions enable the following actions to be taken:

*   **Samsung Calendar**
    *   Create, edit, and delete events on your calendar
    *   Capture info from images to create events
    *   List events for a date range and create repeating events
*   **Samsung Clock**
    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show alarms
    *   Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch
    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show timers
*   **Samsung Notes**
    *   Create and summarize notes
    *   Retrieve your notes based on descriptions and titles
*   **Samsung Reminder**
    *   Create reminders for a specific time or date
    *   Edit a reminder’s name, time or date
    *   Search for reminders by name, time or date
    *   Delete reminders

Comments:
why would it ever be limited to only certain devices? It runs from servers
I just want samsung apps to use Google drive and not onedrive! Let me backup my photos without the need for Google photos
Will this be an automatic update to the gemini app in playstore - or is it a server side thing

does this also include the rumoured Advanced voice under Flash 2.0?   
Similar to the one on Ai Studio - hoping to have something comparable to chatgpt advance voice - but not sure if google has that ready just yet
Personal Assistant's feel like deja vu. 

I swear the features were promised before and called something else, but were never used/ worked. 

But hey, maybe this time is different.
Maybe this is not be the best place to ask but ever I used to be able to activate google assistant and tell it to take a screenshot.  Now when I squeeze my phone, I get gemini and it doesn't allow you to take screenshots.  The volume rocker fell off my phone so I'm not sure how the hell else I'm supposed to do it.  Is there any other way to take a screenshot?
Great, more things I'll have to disable. I really hate that they have nothing else interesting so this is what they add in.
[deleted]
Mine seems dumb as rocks truthfully I wouldn't trust it to tell me the date.
Yet it still doesn't have Google Assistants ""Are you felling Luck,"" it was a blast while it lasted.
Can't comment on phone functionalities, but Gemini Advanced has been a game changer for me at work. Helping me research, explain what models to use on my data, helping me with coding as well. It's insanely bumped up my learning and productivity. 

I have a feeling a lot of our work might not be the same in the next 2-3 years.
I wish they could add schedules & multiple actions.

I can tell Bixby to turn on my apartment lights after X minutes, if I ask Gemini the same command, it'll tell me that it's not capable of scheduling actions.

Before I was able to do it with Google Assistant. 

I wish Samsung keep improving Bixby & routines they're much better at performing devices-based actions & can understand my accent much better than Google.
Gemini can't set two alarms at once. 

Even google assistant could. 

I use voice assistant more than most, and it's been a massive downgrade.
[deleted]
It's an artificial limitation to drive interest/sales for the new devices. Happens all the time.
Need the earth-shattering awesome power of the Snapdragon (insert latest model) chip to power this absolute beastly feature! If you don't have it on your phone, you're literally a loser and girls won't like you! Buy it today!
Genuine question after watching Samsung announcement: they said (like ten times) that most of the AI thingy will be processed internally instead of on servers to protect data and to run without and internet connexion. So it may be this? I'm having a hard time to believe the data protection aspect coming from Google tho.
Because $$$$$$$$.
Fair, me too. As a workaround, you can use the Samsung MyFiles app, sign in to your Google Drive and manually backup your photos, all while using only the Samsung ecosystem.
>Will this be an automatic update to the gemini app in playstore - or is it a server side thing

Automatic update to the Gemini service, which is part of the Google App. The Gemini app on the Play Store is just a shortcut to the Gemini service.

>does this also include the rumoured Advanced voice under Flash 2.0?   
Similar to the one on Ai Studio - hoping to have something comparable to chatgpt advance voice - but not sure if google has that ready just yet

Nothing related to that was announced today.
You could ask verbally or type it to take a screenshot, but that's inconvenient... 

Maybe something like this? https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dvg.easyscreenshot

Or maybe there's an accessibility shortcut built in you could activate
If you activate circle to search it lets you crop and save a screenshot.
So what do you want then?
Yes. Open Gemini, settings, at the bottom switch assistants, and select Google Assistant.

It's not forced yet
Don't enable it, hope this helps!
If you tailor your use of it and know its strengths and weaknesses, you can actually get a lot of use out of it.  

For example, whenever a company sends me a spec sheet of a device in a PDF document, instead of manually typing out the specs, I just ask a chatbot to scrape it and convert it to HTML for me to paste. Saves me a ton of time.
Spam? It's a summary of the Gemini-related news that Google announced today, written by me.
and it's scummy and pathetic every time
It's not true they're not gonna be. Local models can fix your typos, not find you the best restaurant or process what you're seeing and look it up. By the way, you can already run local models no problem, see app like pocket pal. It's a completely arbitrary limitation
Probably better battery tech and easier ways to replace parts so we can keep things longer if they're running out of ideas. I get that doesn't help the profit margin though. Haha I just don't want a ton of ai stuff. It takes up a lot of space and I feel like it's glitchy and not worth it for most stuff.
If you do that, you can't use Gemini as an app tho, it has to be your main assistant or else the app will try to get you to switch your default assistant to it and close if you refuse.

Really annoying cause I want to use Gemini as an app and Google Assistant as my assistant because of their functional differences.

Add a chrome shortcut to your home screen for Gemini maybe? You wouldn't have Gemini live I don't think unless they update the website with it too which they often do after a bit. Sometimes the website gets the new models first it's kind of random lol

This setup strikes a perfect balance between functionality and personalization. It’s a dynamic system that keeps me organized, inspired, and connected. 

I am curious, how do you customize your Pixel's home screen?  I am always looking for ways for further refinement. 

Comments:
So many words without any screenshots?
Pictures please?
Someone ban this guy for being too cringe. He clearly needs the push to go outside and touch grass.
Mine is set up so I don't need to swipe on my screen 8 times to get to an app. 

One folder for social media in my dock, one more for content consumption (audio and video). The dialer and camera are also in the dock. The rest of the screen is blank aside from at a glance which has smartspacer set to show weather, upcoming events, and battery levels.

Second home page has widgets to show stocks, photos, time zones of the family. 

There is no need for redundancy. Anything I need frequently can be accessed in one tap/swipe the home screen, e.g. communication, media, weather.

Things that are needed slightly less frequently (like settings, games, banking apps, etc can be accessed in 2 interactions with either the app drawer or quick settings/notifications panel.
Damn feels like reading an AI breakdown of your screenshots. Please tell me you didn't?

https://i.imgur.com/Zi6qvfP.png

https://i.imgur.com/YfjkfIv.png

https://i.imgur.com/nY6oIxs.png

Personally I don't find it very pleasing. Everything is too large (appreciate that can be accessibility though it's just personal for me), looks fisher price style when everything is comically large which is a Pixel gripe overall of mine. Maybe try lowering display size and keeping text as normal if you can? I feel it gives a good balance and readability. 

The glaring white bar felt like looking into a nuke reactor when the image loaded, dark mode helps but as much as material you falls short, adding some colour and flare is what it at least does well. Mine pulls the green and slightly pinkish colour for the overall theme. Only apps with themed icons grace my homescreen unless I can hide the icons in a folder. 

If you really wanted and had some time I think you could make some better widgets in KWGT or find some material style ones that fit the overall UI better. I don't really use them specifically because android ones always look terrible. 

The amount of folders and apps in folders is overwhelming and maximilist (sp?). While a learning curve it would probably end up being more productive getting in the habit of searching apps especially as you have a lot rather than going digging through folders. 

A couple of examples are the folders with two apps in. Granted you could add more in future, clock and calculator are generally at the top of the app list within thumbs reach with one swipe up. Seems easier than swiping across, tapping a folder then the icon, no? Proton is a tool, could go in the folder, Reddit is a social could go in social ect. 

One thing I like about my setup is it's fairly easy to remember what goes where as there's not much if I forget to backup and reset or switch phones or something - for whatever reason homescreen layouts never copy 1:1 for me so I prefer to do it from scratch. 

Not to dog on your style, just trying to offer suggestions I've noticed and my style opinion
Idk why, but this entire post feels stupid to me. You have a PIXEL and have an app drawer just a swipe up away, unlike iPhones with app library to the right end of pages.

It's not like you're going to browse those categories and then find the app you're expecting to open. In a Pixel, just a flick up and you can find it alphabetically or through the search bar at the top.
Mine is similar for the first 3 pages, but I prefer to not show the dock or notifications bar at all, making for a page with just my beautiful wallpaper.    Nova Launcher Pro for the win.
But at the end of all that, you still have a Pixel.

Edit:  I've read like 1/10th of the way through this and am convinced you have bodies buried in your crawlspace.
[removed]
I use Smart Launcher. I keep my most used apps on 1 and 2 screens with some widgets.


Everything else can be found by search.

I also have smart categories which automatically categories all my apps in games, utilities, and other sections based on function in all apps screen. Manual sorting and categorization is a bit tedious IMHO.

I'm trying to get used to searching for apps but damn it is hard to change habits. Really doesn't help the open on enter was removed ages ago and now it Google searches 🙄 probably a cheap way to push up search engagement lol
I find it extremely efficient, I love that my first home screen has all my primary apps, but mostly shows the glorious Earth, in Real Time. By the way, and then my second page I have memorized by groups
Do you think I should get Nova? I'm assuming they're free and paid versions, and if the ladder, is it a one-time payment or a monthly subscription? 

And how easy is it to transport my current setup into something that is even better?
By the way, I see you have T-Mobile, did you get the email about signing up early for the beta use of Starlink satellites for basically coverage no matter where you are on Earth?

Lmao! I am here - just give me a second and I'll respond.
If you call this extremely efficient, then I believe that you know how to make this more gore and complex. Some of your apps aren't even categorised.

Reddit - next to the Social Media folder on Page 2

Calendar - duplicate shortcut for Calendar app on Page 1 as you can directly tap on At a Glance date to open it. (Don't even talk about the one-hand approach, Page 2 has app folders all over the screen)

Photos - Why is this app even separated from Google apps???


Do it properly, else don't do it.
And there's no point in calling it efficient when you have 9 pages of apps.
That's up to you.  I paid once.  You won't be able to do a simple import though because Google doesn't provide any export syntax.  You have to build up manually.
> I'm assuming they're free and paid versions, and if the ladder, is it a one-time payment or a monthly subscription? 

Nova has a Prime version that's a ~US$5 OTP.

> And how easy is it to transport my current setup into something that is even better?

No, because 1—Google (like most Android OEMs) doesn't include an import/export function for launcher layouts, and 2—in most launchers that have such a function, it only works when you're installing that exact same launcher on a new device (e.g. you can migrate your layout from Nova on a Galaxy to Nova on a Pixel, but you can't migrate it from Nova to Lawnchair or Microsoft Launcher).

> Can you explain in a few sentences why it's worth it to you?

Here's a non-exhaustive list of the features I found most useful in Nova, that I wish Pixel Launcher also had but that it currently lacks—

- You can use icon packs and relabel apps.
- You can put long widgets in the dock; I used this to squeeze in Smartspacer (replaces the At a Glance widget), Rushikesh Kamewar's Pixel Search bar (a third-party version of Google's Pixel Search) Pocket Casts's playback control bar, and 6 app icons and folders.
- You can add up to 5 pages in the Dock to fit more widgets or app icons.
- You can change the grid size in both the Home Screen and the App Drawer in Nova far bigger than in Pixel Launcher; as I recall, I used 6x8 for the former, 6x9 for the latter.
- You can add folders and tabs in the App Drawer.
- You can open apps and shortcuts using swipe/tap gestures on the Home Screen; I had ""Double tap + swipe down"" and ""Two finger swipe down"" both set to open Quick Settings, and ""Double tap + swipe up"" and ""Two finger swipe up"" both set to open 1Password; if I'd been smart, I would've also used ""Double tap"" to open Google Wallet. (A lot of people use ""Double tap"" to lock their home screen.)
- Nova Launcher integrates with Sesame Shortcuts so that you can customize what happens when you swipe up on an app icon.
- You can overlap widgets and control which one is on top using ""Bring to front"" and ""Send to back"" options that appear when you press and hold a widget; you get even finer control over widget placement and overlapping if you turn on ""Subgrid positioning"". I used this to squeeze a Google Calendar widget and a TickTick ""weekly"" widget onto the same Home Screen.

> Do you think I should get Nova?

The only reason I'm gonna say ""No, wait"" instead of ""Fuck yes"" is that Nova's future is uncertain right now. [Back in August 2024, the company that has owned Nova since 2022—a digital analytics company called Branch—abruptly laid off all but one of Nova's developers](https://www.androidpolice.com/exclusive-cliff-wade-nova-launcher-interview/) and discontinued the Discord channel that Nova's development team used to communicate with end-users, leading to headlines like [""Saying Goodbye to Nova: The Launcher That Changed How I Use Android""](https://www.howtogeek.com/saying-goodbye-to-nova-the-launcher-that-changed-how-i-use-android/) and [""Nova Launcher, savior of cruft-filled Android phones, is on life support""](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/nova-launcher-savior-of-cruft-filled-android-phones-is-on-life-support/). Even before the layoffs, I noticed that it seemed like the development team's resources were being stretched thin; it happened several times where I got an email from the development team confirming that a fix for a bug I'd reported would be included in the next update, yet the bug wasn't fixed in that update.

For now I'm using Niagara Launcher Pro; sideloading [Lawnchair 14](https://lawnchair.app/) is also a good option, but it's more limited and less power-user-friendly compared to Nova (though still a giant improvement over Pixel Launcher).
Yes but it sounds as if it's only going to work with Samsung phones to begin with.  So not terribly useful to me.

Your groundbreaking dissertation on app placement has shaken me to my core. Google Photos not in the ""correct"" folder? Ghastly! Western civilization teeters on the brink. Let’s address your grievances:

* **Reddit next to Social Media:** Not exactly a Geneva Conventions violation, but I get it—you have strong feelings.
* **Calendar Shortcut:** Redundancy? Sure. Or maybe I just enjoy having options. Shocking, I know.
* **Photos Placement:** It’s for *memories*, not your crusade for folder purity. Blew your mind, right?

Efficiency is overrated when personality is the goal. But your zeal for app order truly inspires me—next time, I’ll be sure to submit my layout for your approval. ;)

Until then, maybe touch some grass. Or at least swipe up on your app drawer and chill.
Is it worth it
That's not what I read, they basically just said it needed to be a relatively new smartphone, what I recall reading is that it could be a Samsung or a Pixel.
To me it is.
Can you explain in a few sentences why it's worth it to you?
Allows a lot of customization.  A lot more than the default.

Android,App recommendations to take screenshot beyond fullscreen?,"So in Android, there's a feature on my Pixel 9 Pro where if I hit the Volume-Down and Power button at the same time, I can take a screenshot of, say, a long text message without having to scroll and take three or four screenshots to get the same content. The thing is that it doesn't always work, especially if I'm trying to take a snapshot somewhere in the middle or if there's a video involved. 

Does anyone know of a third-party app that perhaps might do this better? Thanks!

Android,Pixel vs Samsung (OneUI) features - Trying to make a list,"I'm trying to make a list of what you gain or lose in Samsung's environment versus Google's. 

This is a list of features I could think of that are on one platform, but not the other. 

Samsung Exclusives:

* **Dex** Desktop Android - ~~Going away in OneUI 7~~ The desktop app is going away, Dex is staying.
* ~~**SD Cards**~~ - None of their new phones, after the S20, have SD card slots
* **Split audio** - You can pipe one app through one output and another app through another output (e.g. Chrome goes through the phone's speakers and YouTube goes through Bluetooth) 
* **Game mode** - Little features that make gaming easier, like locking the screen from touches, performance mode, hiding notifications, etc... 
* **Being able to map double clicking the power button to the flashlight instead of the camera** - This one ANNOYS THE SHIT OUT OF ME on Pixel. Moto let's you karate chop, Samsung let's you remap the power button, Pixel tells you to go fuck yourself even though there are literally hundreds and hundreds of complaints about this on their support forums and reddit. 
* **All of the Samsung ecosystem** - Bixby, Samsung Wallet, Samsung Find My Device, Galaxy App Store, etc... Not that anyone actually uses any of this. 
* **Miracast** - You can mirror your screen wirelessly to Roku sticks or any TV (most TVs) that support Miracast.
* **Reset phone after 15 unlock attempts** - For some reason even though Apple and Samsung offer this feature, Pixel doesn't. 
* **Repeat notifications** - If you get a text or something you can make the phone ding multiple times instead of once (this is possible on Pixel with the Buzzkill app) 

Google Exclusives: 

~~* **Call screening** - Unknown callers or people you don't want to talk to talk to Google and you see a text transcription on your phone~~ Bixby Text Call does this 
 
* **Text transcriptions of voicemails** - Visual Voicemail without have to pay for it from the carrier (or use Google Voice)
* **Wait on hold for me / Text navigation of IVRs** - Google goes through IVRs and alerts you when a human comes on the line
* **Call summaries** - After years of actively blocking call recording (at least in the US) they now let Gemini Nano listen to your calls and make a call summary afterwards (at least on Pixel 9 and above - not on 8a) 
* **Seamless updates** - Updates install in the background, you reboot your phone, it's installed. Doesn't take 10+ minutes of installing 

They both have a bunch of AI camera stuff. Mainly the same functionality. 

It really seems like the unique features are the least unique they've ever been. Things like one hand mode, lock down, work profile, etc... that used to be OneUI exclusives were just absorbed by AOSP/Pixel. 

I'm sure I'm missing many things - Can you help me fill out the list?

Dex is not going anywhere they are just removing the Windows app
https://preview.redd.it/77obiaf5ddae1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dfeb91cfd29a62757dcfd834fd465223d39a90c

Does Pixel have a customisation on the same level with Samsung GoodLock capabilities? I was shocked when I first discovered this official application because the level of customisation is insane. For example, the default Samsung home app launcher supports icon packs from Icon Pack Studio using ThemePark from GoodLock (I changed my icons to black-and-white using it). Also, the OneHandOperation+ gives ability to introduce more gestures and more actions which can be triggered by these gestures - for example, If I swipe from left of my screen to the right-top, the popup will appear where you can place any widgets (see screenshot) - a great place for shortcuts like dimming the screen (The screen of my phone is too bright for me sometimes, I want to reduce the level of brighteness by one click without disabling adaptive brightness). There are a lot of other examples like rearranging the settings entries, extended lock screen customisation, extended routines (by the way, does Pixel provide some alternative for routines?), or even the history of all notifications or actions such as vibrations.
Samsung has Text call, it doesn't answer for you but transcribes the other side so that you can reply in text, which would then be spoken to the other end. It can also live translate calls to another language. None of these are limited to US as well.

Also, Dex is not being removed.
For me it's mainly Good lock that differentiates Samsung. All the customization option it offers on a stock launcher. And my absolute favorite is One Hand Operation+ (completely customize how gestures works and what they do, you can set different angles, swipe times and lengths), it has so many different options and have completely changed how I use and navigate my device so it's hard to use anything else now.
Split screen:


* Can initiate it via side panel or by long pressing recents (latter requires Good Lock)


* Can swap bottom app while keeping the top app active (via side panel)
My pixel has some gaming mode too. Shows fps and can hide notifications, shortcut for screen recording and cpu optimization
[Heres my similar list](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1d0kjtm/things_missing_in_pixel_ui/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), some things like an 80% charge limit have been added recently on pixel, also on pixel there's no windowed mode and split- screen functionality is limited (can only select from already opened apps in recents). ...and dex is not being removed. 
Dex is here to stay, only the Windows app is being depreciated 
- being able to invert back and recent button on samsung.
- being able to remove 'google now' widget from the top of the homescreen on samsung stock launcher.
- being able to remove the google search bar from the bottom of the homescreen on samsung stock launcher.
Secure folder is amazing. It's the one thing that stops me buying a non Samsung phone!
As far as I know, Samsung already has all the ones you put as Google Exclusives except for the IVR thing and seamless updates (which is coming with the S25s)

Also DeX is not going away yet, only the Windows app is.
Apparently from what I’ve read, the S25 series will have seamless updates.
Can you easily set a private DNS on pixel phones? Don't think I could live without that feature.


Also, the private folder on Samsung works really well. 
if you are comparing features with samsung and pixel samsung will always win in a big way.
Samsung partially disables the ""move app to SD card"" functionality by automatically moving the app back to device memory when the app is next updated. I don't think Pixel does that.
Samsung exclusive: the smart select screenshot panel is amazing
Pixel Now Playing
It might be that I have an Ultra model Galaxy and a base tier Pixel 8, but I've found that the Pixel is really bare bones. I just can't do most of what I do on a Galaxy phone on a Pixel. Google's first-party apps are terrible, which puts a lot of pressure on the Play Store to have what you're looking for. It often doesn't, or it does but the app is malware/full of ads/requires a premium purchase to get basic functions. 

I've done a lot of comparison research between the S24U and the Pixel 9 Pro XL. The Pixel is *almost* there, but Samsung still has the advantage. If the S25 has 16GB of RAM, it's going to stay ahead of the Pixel unless Google puts dramatic upgrades in the Pixel 10.
You forgot the most important thing. Good Lock. The level of customization it provides is unrivaled by any manufacturer.
For Google there's also now playing also ability to select text and crop out images from recents
You can set a double tap on the back of the phone to enable flashlight on Pixel, if you want.

Could probably also remap double press of the power button with ButtonMapper from the Play Store.
Please let this comment be higher
I edited the list.
Honestly, One Hand Operation+ is the number one reason that keeps me on Samsung! I've just grown so used to it, and so much muscle memory has been built up, having almost every little action mapped to some functionality, that it would be hard to lose that with any other phone.
What do you actually use it for? 

Like I use the private folder in Google Photos for my dick pics, isn't that the same thing sort of? 

Is this ""Safe Folder"" the same thing? https://support.google.com/files/answer/9935264?hl=en#zippy=%2Cset-up-your-safe-folder%2Cmove-files-to-your-safe-folder%2Cadditional-information
>Can you easily set a private DNS on pixel phone

Yeah that's an AOSP feature
Private dns is on samsung as well. Settings > connections > more connection settings
None of the new flagship level Samsung phones have SD card slots.
I have a bunch of apps that I want to keep separate from the rest of my stuff.  Things that I log into with work accounts and work social accounts, it's easier than logging out of a personal account and into one I use for work.  
No idea about safe folder. Can you use it to sandbox extra instances of apps?
I thought that was the ""Work Profile""?
No idea, I don't use a pixel. Secure folder is like a separate phone that you can install apps on and store files in, the only thing that it shares is the network stack. You can pretty much hide that exists while still having it activated as well.",2024-12-30 01:56:39,23,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1hpc3s7/pixel_vs_samsung_oneui_features_trying_to_make_a/
Android,"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.

I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:

1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the ""on-ice"" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).
2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.
3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.

Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?

Comments:
the scrolling is the opposite for me. I hate ios scrolling and think its a tragedy that such a fast cpu gets such a slow web experience on scrolling. 


apps kinda, I prefer android reddit apps (and like I can still use custom apps now) and other hacked apps. The only apps I can remember being an issue in the last 5 years is clubhouse and cruise. Its not like early android where instagram and uber were ios only at first

speakers idk i dont use them past 20% volume
Use an Android phone for as long as you've used your iPhones, then try to switch back. It's mostly just which thing you're used to.
1. I HARDDDD disagree. Iphones feel so slow, including scrolling. Scrolling jelly effect is just maddening more than anything. I can't describe it but it just feels too fucking slow. (And the same goes for the whole UI feeling slow. Drives me NUTS)

Other issues I respect. And I see iphones being better at lots of things than android. 

But scrolling speed and UI speed, is one of my main issues.
I can't really say there's a way to alter the scrolling experience. Newer android phones are way better than android phones, say 5 ot 10 years ago.

The way iOS handles scrolling, the moment your finger touches the screen, it makes scrolling the highest priority, to the point where screen refresh or data loading is halted until you've let go of the screen and the scrolling has finished scrolling on the screen, at which point it will load in new data. 

On android, this doesn't occur and so depending on how much data is loading, it can sometimes result in small hiccups when you're scrolling while the app is loading photos or content because on android it'll be handling content fetching while scrolling at the same time.  

The one thing you can play around with is animations. If you enable developer settings, you can change animations to 0.5x, which will make certain interactions feel quicker than stock out of the box.
I agree with the apps thing, just pulling up Cashapp on Android & iOS, the dofference is telling.
""Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"" 


Frankly, yes. And that's not even a shot at Apple, it's just that these are all things you'd get used to if you lived with an Android phone for any extensive amount of time. Scrolling feels perfectly fine for me on my Galaxy, 99.9% of apps I use work with no problems, and phone speakers are not really a consideration for me since I almost exclusively use headphones. Honestly I think it's mostly just a matter of what you're used to.
2 is true everywhere, ios just makes more money for app makers and has way less phones for them to worry about
I switched from iOS to Android back in 2022 and I still use iPadOS just about daily so I think I can answer some of these!


1. Just kinda takes getting used to. It was about a week long learning curve for me and now iOS/ iPadOS scrolling feels slow (still miss double tap status bar for home)


2. The app situation is complicated, a lot of it depends on what hardware devs will optimize for. For instance I know Google makes deals with social platforms to make sure they're optimized for their cameras, but with the number of phones out there there's no way to optimize for all of them. In terms of more niche apps Apple has the best selection of polished niche little note taking apps, photo editing apps, etc. (though Android has some of their own within this category, but they are harder to find) while Android has a lot more of those nitty gritty apps that enable different UX, features, etc. I think in general Android has all the big apps, but there are a lot of devs in the US that really just focus on the Apple ecosystem for their apps/ services.


3. Again it just kind of depends on the hardware. I think Samsung is finding corners to cut as they're becoming an even more distant second place, while Google is still trying to woo new customers so they're more likely to try and keep up.


In general there isn't one android, there's so many different versions, so many different phones, so many different experiences vs just, you know, the iPhone and iOS; and that's all for good and for ill imo.
I could not disagree more with you on the scrolling. It's so much slower on iPhone. Scrolling on iOS feels like scrolling through mud, whereas on android you actually have control with inertia on how far or not you scroll. And it's buttery smooth. Also scrolling on Reddit/X used to be choppy on Pixels, they aren't anymore (thank God)
The app thing is a dev problem. But we are the consumer. So imo it's a android issue regardless of whose at fault. Unless you think, oh it's the devs fault I can accept lower quality.
I use both platforms daily (Android as my personal phone, iPhone as my work phone), so don't fully agree with your post.

**Scrolling**

Honestly, this is a matter of preference. I much prefer Android's scrolling and interaction behaviour, and a flagship Android running at 120Hz is definitely smoother than an iPhone running at 120Hz.

The icy scrolling and eased-in animations for every interaction might make iOS *appear* to be smoother, but it's just slower to navigate. I feel much more productive using an Android phone because opening, closing and switching between apps is much quicker. Android's scrolling behaviour is a lot more consistent and handles inertial scrolling better than iOS, where I often find myself over or underscrolling to get to a certain point. I'm sure Apple is aware of this as well, which is why they have native tap-to-top and tap to bottom actions within the OS.

The stutter you're referring to is an app issue with how content is loaded. Like Twitter, which loads maybe 10 posts in a timeline and then spends a second or so refreshing after scroll. I don't think you should be conflating them into the same issue, since one is a preferential one, and the other is just a lazy developer problem.

> **Apps**

Again, this is a preference thing. Funny enough, the third-party apps you mentioned, with the exception of Flighty, don't hold a candle to comparative apps on Android. Overcast and Apollo in particular are massively overrated apps that would be in the bottom 10 compared to similar apps on Android.

I don't disagree that iOS has some truly exceptional apps (Darkroom, MusicHarbor, Procreate, etc.) but the same is true for Android.

> **Speakers**

This one I agree with. iPhones do stereo speaker setups better than any Android phone I've used, and their playback of audio via Bluetooth is also best in class at all volume levels.

It's actually the biggest reason I use an iPhone as my work phone- I take a lot of calls for work when not at my desk, and the excellent speakers and voice assist feature for the microphone really help with this.
The app situation is something I've definitely noticed. Anecdotal, I have friends who are private pilots. Overwhelmingly, almost all of them rock iPad minis as their co-pilot and replacement for traditional flight bags. They use Foreflight, Garmin Pilot, etc. Technically, those apps also exist on Android but A) they run better on the iPad Mini due to Apple silicon, B) have proper Apple Pencil support while the S Pen or other input support are dodgy on Android, and C) are updated more frequently and with newer features. Unrelated to the app situation but the peripheral support is also way better for the iPad mini with aviation-specific cases and even onboard fans and mounting platforms to keep the iPad cool in direct sunlight during flight. This one highlights more of the lack of support overall on Android and not necessarily specific to only apps.
I have been an Android user for close to 10 years, but I've always had an iPhone for work.  I'm based in the US as well

Credit to you for not being entrenched in the Apple ecosystem (while living in the US) because arguably lack of iMessage and FaceTime are probably the hardest hurdles in making the jump 

To your points

1. Just a matter of what you get used to. Having used Android for personal and iPhone for work both for a long time, I prefer my Pixel's scrolling feel

2. 100% agree on this point. I'm not a big social media user, but even apps for fast casual chains (e.g., Sweetgreen) are an atrocious experience compared to iOS. Frankly, this has been the biggest downside of Android for me (now that RCS resolves the messaging issues)

3. No comment - not particularly important for me

Conversely, there are a few things my Pixel does that my iPhone does not (that I heavily prefer in a phone)

1. I like the ability to use Google messages on a computer regardless of whether it is a Mac or not (i.e., can't use iMessage on my Windows Desktop

2. I use the Hold for Me function on phone calls very frequently 

3. I like the ability to schedule a message to send later regardless of whether or not the recipient is an iMessage user

4. I like that my reminders stay in the notification tray. On iPhone, they disappear into the void known as the Notification Center if you don't act on the reminder early on (for third party reminder apps -- Apple made an exclusion for their first party app to always stay on the lock screen, and there is no way to emulate)
Scrolling is trash on iOS devices with proMotion display. It's like 80fps on a 120hz display with no Vsync. The stutter and jitter are unbearable. It's been a thing since the first high refresh rate iphone and still the same on the latest 16 pro max.
Just came back from 2 years as an iPhone user,  and couldn't be happier. No more seeing if my phone will sync or not. Not sure what scrolling you are talking about.
You should try the Razr & make sure you have scrolling setup to how you like it.
See the phones in my flair. 

Scrolling: I haven't noticed a difference between platforms.

Apps: I have both platforms so it doesn't matter to me. 

Speakers: My 15+ has more bass, but as I mostly listen via earbuds it doesn't matter to me. S24U is excellent for listening while showering.
Imagine saying 60hz feels better than 120hz...
I have a ""pro"" iPhone and the scrolling is slower than my Samsung S23 


iPhones are terrible at multitasking and shows when you try to run multiple apps at once 


For example when you watch a YouTube video and leave to do something else, it doesn't continue where you left off 
I've been a mobile developer for like 10 years now and everywhere I've worked has prioritized iOS, either skipping android altogether, building the android app after the iOS app, or just giving less developers/time to android. But according to analytics, there are always more iOS users
Your 2nd point is irrelevant because the same is true in the opposite direction. Some apps are platform centric. That's just how it is.

I wouldn't trade most of the Android apps for their iOS equivalents.
 I left iOS for android because android has better accessibility support. I’ve been using it now for over a year, and do you know how many times my screen reader has stopped talking to me requiring me to restart at six times? Zero. In that same time, iOS has done it at least seven times a week, sometimes seven times a day. I see why you might be bothered by the scrolling thing. Honestly, I like it better though. You’re not only allowed to scroll one page at a time.
For me it's the opposite with iOS on point 1. I want snappier motion cause I have a a high refresh display and modern phones don't need to ""hide"" loading times anymore. iOS is way too ""floaty"" by comparison and I have stuff to do!
Apps and speakers I can agree. 

But scrolling is a hard no. Scrolling is infinitely better in android
God iOS feels so horrible and janky to me anymore because of the scrolling lol
Honestly, as true as this all is, android is going to die out in the US in less than 10 years. There is a 99% penetration rate of iphone among 16-30 year olds.

The only people I see with android phones are people over the age of 50 or 60. 

You can get a used iphone 13 for 400 dollars, now, on ebay. The next iPhone SE is about to come out with the latest processor and will be 400 dollars, max. Wait 3 months, and you can buy it refurbished and on sale at various places for 300-350. 

There is no way android can compete. Between buying an iphone with the latest processor and 7+ years up updates for 300 bucks, and a new android phone for 300 dollars, the vast majority of people are better served by buying a 1-2 generation old iphone or a iPhone SE. It's literally cheaper than any android device, unless you want some bottom of the barrel mid grade trash of an android for 200 buck that will crap out after a year and never be supported. I've bought my fair share of mid grade android phones (hello, moto G) and over the years I have spent far more money than if I had just ponied up and spent 400 bucks on a damn iPhone. 

Everyone has realized that iphones are overwhelmingly a better deal. It's not a debate.
Completely agree. I've always been on Android. Even putting a contact into an iPhone was confusing for me. When you're so used to one or the other, using the opposite system feels totally foreign and wrong.
I can second this. I had a 16 Pro Max for a bit and it just felt clunky and slow when it came to scrolling. Everything is so drawn out for the sake of animations (which one may obviously appreciate), but after using android and dropping my animations speeds down to 0.5X, iPhones just feel slow.
It’s probably the case that the scrolling is more about preference then, but on Android it just feels so bad in my experience that it’s hard for me to understand a preference for it
That’s really the bigger issue than simply the “feel” of the scrolling - the stuttering and hiccups are really bad in a lot of apps. The best example I have is in Twitter/X, where any time you scroll over an ad in the feed, the scrolling grinds and stutters to a halt. It just makes the phone feel underpowered and lower quality
This is the one thing I noticed coming from an iPhone 14 Plus to the Pixel 9 Pro. I really thought Google would have improved in this area. It's not so much an issue in Chrome but third party apps scroll like Michael J Fox unless you tap swipe and let go.
I’ve genuinely tried - I had each of the phones I mentioned pretty much since they came out and used them as my primary devices for months/years but sadly never got used to the scrolling or speakers and felt disappointed every time a new app came out only for iPhone or updates far in advance
Back to 2. again for a beat:


I'd say the iOS app situation is definitely better on average but the other part of this conversation I think is how Android lets you use the apps you have. 


I'm a Spotify user, so on iOS I was relegated to using the stock alarm sounds since the only way to use music for your alarm was to be an Apple Music subscriber. 


I've always used Google for photo backups and when I was using an iPhone I had to pay for both iCloud and Google Drive space despite preferring Google Photos, all due to Apple only allowing you to use their own app for a photo picker across all apps.


I like using Firefox but it's not really worth using on iOS since only Safari is allowed to use extensions and ad blockers.


I think this is a part of the conversation that typically ends up getting missed when talking about apps and the iOS vs Android experience. It's also a big part of what's kept me on Android these past couple of years.
I can appreciate that a lot of what I said is more preference based than I’m giving it credit for. I honestly just wish either platform really gave more customization over scrolling feel and behavior, but that might be more complex or cause more unintended side effects than I realize.
I agree with a lot of your points about the Pixel. I think it’s generally a good phone, but the grievances I have with it and Android phones in general keep me from really enjoying it. Google is making some really great advances in their phones lately, and they’re far ahead of Apple in any useful AI features. Hoping they continue and provide Apple with some competition in the coming years.
It’s really hard for me to understand where you’re coming from here because it just hasn’t been my experience at all. I can definitely tell that the display isn’t always hitting 120hz while scrolling around, but the general scrolling experience is so much smoother without stuttering or weird inertia issues that it feels significantly better
Maybe in the US, but globally, it's android... there are more android devices than iOS....
And the difference to develop apps between iOS and android is just the fact that nearly every ipad or iphone is based on its predecessor while android has hundreds of different types and gadgets etc. 
Which, long story short, needs more time or profession to deal with...
I get why, because I think its been stated Apple likes the illusion on no loading. So the slow scrolling allows UI to load behind the scenes and not pause to buffer or load (like it photos app). 

But android is full steam ahead which is what I prefer. I wanna fling and accelerate faster at times. Even if I hit a ""figurative wall"" and needs to load for half a second. I still can scroll further than ios in the same time. And thats why I prefer.
Yeah, it may just be a sensitivity. I use apps similar to what you mentioned (Reddit, Threads, Insta), and the scrolling is fine. On Reddit, it's very quick and feels great. I also have an iPad Pro with 120hz so that should be similar to an iPhone, but I never feel weird about it when going back to my phone, so hard to say.
Why even bother dude? Just stick to Apple, clearly there are no other phones for you. Enjoy the pretty walled garden and don't bother looking over the fence.
Honestly I'm sitting here comparing my pixel 9 and 16 pro and the fact that you even posted this means you are so stuck in your apple ways it's not even worth discussing. 

iPhone scrolling and animations are so slow and unnecessary. Enjoy your iPhone bro
That's a Twitter problem, though. The app is pretty crap on Android.

Equally, it's not a baseline for performance on the platform.
I'm very much in the live and let live camp - me from 5 years ago would actively try to convert people to Android but these days I say use whatever phone makes you the happiest

I'm curious what about Apple phones aren't doing it for you (apart from not using the 1st party apps, and not caring about iMessage)?
I agree that it's not everyone's issue. But if you want to see it, look really carefully as the inertia comes to a stop. That minor stutter is there because the way the display ramps down its refresh rate. Another example is in app with lots of text e.g. the reddit app, flick the screen and watch for tearing/jelly effect. That's clearly variable refresh rate not working correctly.
I like trying new phones and there’s a lot about the Android OS that I like, so I keep wanting to try phones as they come out 🤷‍♂️
It doesn’t really matter if it’s the fault of the Android OS or the specific apps’s developer, though. It’s ultimately a worse experience than on iOS, so it’s a problem when using Android phones either way.
I’m a big fan of the universal back button/gesture - needing to extend my thumb all the way over to the left side of the screen to go back on iPhone really annoys me. Also, I don’t like notifications at all on iOS and think Android handles it much better. Pixels definitely have a bunch of useful features that iPhones don’t as well, including doing a better job of filtering out spam messages and calls. Siri is practically unusable, and I enjoyed the Gemini integration in the Pixel 9 Pro XL, especially since it came with a Gemini Advanced subscription. Playing with different UI customization options was nice as well, and I find iOS 18 to be pretty buggy right now. Those are the main things I can think of in favor of Android
Yeah but they'll never be Apple, so they will always have enough wrong with them to bring you back to the problems you're comfortable with in Apple. Why torture yourself? Just relax, let it happen.
Sure, that bit I'm not disagreeing with. But the only way to get these lazy app developers to do something about it is to raise the issues with them.

Twitter is known to be terrible on Android (it would be unbearable for me if it wasn't for Revanced). Musk himself knows this and just doesn't care.

And FWIW, the Twitter app on macOS is absolute hot garbage that's effectively abandoned. I think people also forget that a very large percentage of Twitter users on Apple devices used Tweetbot before the API changes killed it.

I don't think it's fair to use a particularly poor app to define the performance and behaviour of the entire ecosystem. Otherwise, I could simply say navigation and scrolling behaviour on iOS is bad because Microsoft Teams and Outlook perform much better on Android than they do on iOS.
Funny enough, I like that iOS has an option to directly jump back into the previous app (e.g., jumping back to email app after clicking link that took you to the browser). I like Android's universal back but sometimes it's unpredictable/takes longer to get back to where you want than you'd hope

Agree on notifications

Thanks for the context
Peak r/Android comment right here. 

There’s nothing wrong with wanting to try other phones when they come out even if you’re fairly certain you’ll end up going back to what you are used to. It’s not “torture” - it’s experimenting, being a tinkerer, being curious. Something you’d think Android users would embrace. 

This is the same as telling someone “why try new foods? You know you’re just gonna go back to what you usually eat in the end anyway. Why torture yourself.”
New foods don't cost a thousand dollars a pop. And so far, not ONE of these phones has not been returned and replaced with an iPhone. Dude listed more phones than I think I've had total.

Like, if you keep going and trying sushi, and every time you're like ""yeah fish is okay but I just really like beef"" and leave mid meal to go to McDonald's, like... It's all fish, it's always gonna taste like fish. It's not McDonald's.
None of that is relevant. It’s not your money, it’s not your hobby, it’s not your decision.

They gave their reason. They like to try the new things that are out there. That’s where it ends.
It's not where it ends, because he has posted it here, publicly, for all to read and respond to. That invites input on his money, hobby, and decision. If he didn't want feedback, he shouldn't have posted on a public forum.

Just as we are here, and you're giving your opinion on my comments. You know what's really off-topic? This convo.

Android,The Google Pixel 9 Pro is the Android Authority Editor's Choice winner for best phone of 2024,"

Comments:
Does anyone have a list of sites that have the Pixel 9 (any sku? as top of their list?

From memory I think T3, Digital Trends, Toms Hardware, Android Police, all list it?
Isn't it always ""Insert newest Pixel Pro phone here"" is editors choice of the year? I mean who even reads this anymore?
*we’re obviously big Pixel fans here*

No shit
I have and generally like the P9PXL. But it's difficult to take this article at face value when Google's biggest selling point for this phone is Gemini and it's integration as a smartphone assistant is absolutely horrendous and currently a gimmick on the same level as Soli was imo. It's so frustrating to be beat over the head with their Gemini commercials knowing that I can't even tell the damn thing to turn off the lights without hearing ""First, unlock your phone.""

Google Assistant is still vastly superior and I have Gemini turned off until they *truly* enable hands-free use of Gemini.
I always take these ""phone of the year"" awards with a pinch of salt.  A lot of tech reviewers (especially US-centric ones) are out of touch with regular consumer habits and are generally rabid fans of Google devices, overlooking their flaws.

Android Authority has had a Pixel as their phone of the year for four years running. Yes, that includes the awful Pixel 6. As someone who has owned both the 6 and 6 Pro and has seen them steer me away from using Google phones as my main device for the foreseeable future, I can't place any value in their recommendations, even if the Pixel 9 series appears to be solid devices.

Funny enough, their reader's choice award (voted by the public) went to the S24 Ultra. I think it's a much better shout as it's simply a lot more accessible to more people in more countries and has better after-sales support options.
Something something Vivo X200 series.


Is it even available in the US? I assume it isnt since ""its one of those chinese brands"" and 'murica doesnt like china that much.
i really, really want the pixel line to succeed. I really do. to me, they should be the iphones of android. the face of the OS. the ""best experience bar none."" 

but... man, the tensor chipset still sucks and their big selling point is fucking GEMINI. and at that price?????? lmao????? 

here's hoping Pixel 10/Pixel X actually addresses the weaknesses of the tensor chip. I don't expect it to be snapdragon or even apple levels of good, but when 1k+ is your asking price...
This is... like... someone paid for the award
It's so hilarious how much this sub hates on pixels over things like the soc, yet everyone outside this sub seems to love them.

Seriously this is one of the most universally negative subs I've been on.
Android authority has picked every pixel since the 6 consistently for phone of the year which is laughable. And this is coming from a 6 pro and 7 pro and 9 pro owner. The only reason I stick with pixels is Google is practically giving them away in the UK for fuck all money and I can live with the compromises for how cheap I can get them.

Tensor is a joke , the AI gimmicks are laughable and their cameras are no longer class leading in multiple areas. The software is good but these are not phone of the year imo
It's the Vivio X100 Ultra
For those of us who live in countries where the Pixel is not for sale: runner up is the Galaxy S24 Ultra.

I did not see the list of all 40 or so phones, and wonder how the Chinese flagships performed. So while we can't buy a Pixel where I live, Huawei (banned in the US) is very much one of the top selling brands here.
As expected, this triggered the salty Pixel haters.
I like the Pixel 9 but I don't get why it keeps winning awards. It is objectively not better than a S24U.
Well, good news for US based android users.

You still have the option of picking two award winning phones! Pick Galaxy or Pixel, and maybe OnePlus if you want to be slightly different. That's it, though.
Definitely not the best phone of the year though I do love mine.
9 Pro is solid so far. I’ve been surprised at how much I’ve defaulted to carrying it daily. It is speedy for my use, camera is great, and size is perfect. I am not much of a mobile gamer so no qualms about the compute power. Battery life is decent. What I would love is a flip foldable  I’ve surprised how much I enjoy using the moto razr+ from this year. I still have my og Fold but use it less because of its heft. 

I still dig the visual design language of the Pixel above other androids. It just feels right to me. YMMV. This is coming from someone who had the OG nexus and never had an iPhone until the X.
I kind of regret my Pixel 9 Pro purchase mainly on the grounds it is trash at gaming. I mean, gone back 10 years in performance in gaming. It's kind of wild really, I hope Google can fix it via software updates.
Pixel 9 Pro is an awesome phone. The design is beautiful, it is smooth (unlike the Pixel 8/8 Pro (excluding the 8a, which I can confirm is smooth and does not stutter), and the regular 9) and despite not being as fast as the Snapdragon powered phones on paper, it is fast enough where you won't notice the difference in day-to-day tasks. 

I just have two problems with it. The first is a minor one; I wish it had a matte frame, like the Pixel 9, not gloss. But the second is a big one, and it's the price. It sits at around €1120 currently in Europe. That is an insane price. Especially because it comes with 128GB storage. 128GB should not be a thing on flagships nowadays. 

""But there is 7 years of updates so it's worth it"". Yes, I agree, if those updates are full updates. But Google have started segmenting them, so the newer phones get more features. Technically, it's 7 years of updates, but you get less and less.

Pixel 9 series should be the following: 

Pixel 9a should be $300.

Pixel 9 should be $500. It is a mid-range phone.

9 Pro should start at $700.

9 Pro XL should start at $800, maybe $850.
The only thing good about the Pixel is the software design. Everything else is meh...
s-samsungbros i don't feel so good....................

Should have been Galaxy S24U
Fair as it's been a big improvement from previous years
Pixel 7 Pro user here. This phone has grown on me. I've never experienced a phone os that didn't progressively become slow and bloated. Even the battery life increased when A14 & A15.

I'm considering the 9 or 10 series next year!
Besides the camera, I really can't see why. The UI software on Pixels is pretty spare compared to Samsung, and the display on the S24 series is nicer with the anti-glare coating and the amazing glass that doesn't get micro scratches.

I'm glad to see that people are stepping away from iPhones to get Pixels though, makes my heart warm.  Also it's nice for Samsung to have a competitor on the Android side again.
[removed]
One Plus 12 is better in almost every way but ok.
Personally I'd give the award to the Nothing Phone 2A. 

I needed a cheap 2nd phone and was really impressed with it. The implementation of Android is better than Pixel's too imo.
The phone literally feels like an iPhone without iOS. I love it.
After getting the 9 Pro and using it a few days, I want my 6 Pro back.
It's my first pixel since 3, I've had mine since launch. I hate this thing and I look forward to the 25U. 

This thing is buggy and the video quality is ass, even with video boost or any other tinkering on the settings.
Yup the phones with the worst quick settings ui out of any phone, buggy 80% charge limit, no desktop mode, no floating windows, no lockscreen widgets and no stock routines/shortcut app.
Typical Rahman sellout
This is impossible with 240hz pwm...
Alright so I have a Pixel 7 and cannot recommend getting a Pixel. 

The phone itself is *fine*, but they drop support for their old phones SO fast. Pixel 8 was announced with a bunch of cloud-based AI stuff. No reason older phones couldn't get them as well, none of it even happens on your phone. But they never pushed it to even the previous model.

I don't even care about that stuff really, but the way they now blatantly withhold things from one-year old phones is gross. 

Apple, Samsung, and even *Xiaomi* now make effort to backport as much as possible to their ""old"" devices. They understand that people develop brand loyalty. Meanwhile, Google wants to say ""check out all this cool stuff only this phone can do!"". That trick only works once.

7 years of version updates is awesome, but they've been making a point to make Android updates increasingly meaningless over the years. They're basically security updates at this point.

And that's just software... Current Pixels have midrange internals for flagship price (they didn't even improve Tensor chips this year). I do actually hope the Tensor gamble pays off... but who knows if they'll just throw in the towel in 2 years? 

They're ending the Pixel tablet lineup already, after one model that just had some phone leftovers shoved in it. Frankly, they can't be trusted to invest in R&D any more.

So yeah... for Android ""experts"" to recommend the most expensive Google phone absolutely reeks of money being thrown their way.
With how good Gemini 2 and Veo2 is looking to be, I think placing a big bet on Google to win at ambient computing and the first actual AGI assistant is pretty safe. They have the best hardware for AI with their TPUs, now if only they could make Tensor less shit.
If you're considering upgrading and are leaning towards a Pixel, don't! 


When I was also planning to upgrade a couple of years ago, here on Reddit here and there I came across articles like this, everywhere there were laudatory reviews about the new best smartphone in the world Pixel 7 pro. Probably even more laudatory than now.


How wrong I was... I can endlessly list the flaws of this device, and I would not buy Pixel again even if it was half the price. 

All these bravura articles on the Internet are paid crap. Pixel is the Tesla of smartphones.
Google should be ashamed for using a 240Hz PWM screen in a $1,000 phone. I’m returning my Pixel 9 Pro XL because it strains my eyes. Avoid this phone if you care about your eye health.
Purchased my son one for Christmas.   Looks like I made a good decision!
Designed by engineers. Every single person who works at Google, from the top to the bottom, uses an iPhone as their daily driver.
The best thing about pixels is how quickly they lose their value. I got a 6A that still has support through 2027 or so for 169 in like new condition. A preposterous deal. Pick your old model and it'll be an absurd price.
I love the pixel 9 series. I own the 9 pro fold and man I love it. Way more than the 16 pro or my previous z fold 5.
A lot of comments saying that the pixel 9 pro should not be best phone of the year, I wonder how many commenters have tried other phones released this year...
People who buy the Pro Pixels and need to justify their really expensive purchase.
Yup. I decided to go back, and their best phones of the last few years...

  
2024: Pixel 9 Pro

2023: Pixel 8 Pro

2022: Pixel 7 Pro

2021: Pixel 6

2020: Dunno - The search results don't actually say, and clicking on them goes to a sort of live content page that has phones from this year in it. 

2019: Pixel 3a XL. I couldn't be arsed to go back any further. 

  
So it doesn't seem like the most illuminating of opinions.
I was so disappointed in Gemini. 

I disabled it after it couldn't properly set reminders. I'd ask it to remind me to do laundry in 30 minutes and it either wouldn't set a time at all, or set the time for the NEXT DAY at a random time. Like, what???

Google better figure it out before they depreciate assistant and replace it fully with Gemini, because that's just unacceptable.
The ""First, unlock your phone."" thing is driving me crazy as well. I hope Google addresses this soon but haven't heard anything :(
All stuff marketed as AI is trash that generates slop that you have to double check.  There hasn't been a single AI product released that's been great for everyday people, that wasn't already a thing like circle to search is just Google Lens in disguise.  95% of people's experience with ""AI"" is that it makes search worse, almost everyone else who uses it gets bored of generating images after a few hours and puts it away.

It's been great for the botting and content farming community though, so there's that.
I felt the same way when Samsung was forcing Bixby down our throats.  It's why I switched to Pixel.  I turned Gemini off really fast.  It's dumber than Google Assistant so what good is it.
P9 is still a great phone without Gemini. You can turn it off if you want to.
Outside of this sub specifically, I don't think I've met a single person who disliked their Pixel phone... At least here in Canada, there's a loooot of Pixel users I see out in the wild.

The vast majority of consumers don't need the latest Snapdragon chip to listen to Spotify, or watch Youtube.
Tbh, the smartphone of the year is either gonna go to Apple, Pixel, or Samsung every year. Idk why people are surprised anymore.

At this point, I feel like these are existing to help people justify their expensive purchases ""yea that's right, I own smartphone of the year"".
A lot of people say nintendo pay for the game of the year awards at the end of 2017 for their ""underpowered"" console. Like that's a lot of websites you have to pay
Not really, it's just the most obvious choice. Shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone
Isn't most Pixel related news like that?
No kidding. I am surprised a lot by that decision.
Anecdotally, I've heard from folks who like their Pixels but remain disappointed that the SoC and battery life aren't better.
Because everyone wants validation. Phones are the tool through which we interact with the world and the choice of which has become more important to our sense of self than our home, car, clothes, makeup, etc.

People see that not-their-phone is recommended over theirs and they feel insulted.
If everyone outside the sub loves the pixel, why is it not even selling that much, even in the US?
We're its biggest fans and also it's harshest critics. This is also the case in any fanbase.
I think it’s entirely dependent on the user’s luck. I’ve only had horror stories with all the pixels I’ve owned, and I haven’t heard a single friend who had a Pixel that didn’t cause them tons of issues. Even in multiple countries with different bands and different carriers. They all ended up selling them or moving to iOS completely.
[deleted]
I doubt anyone loves pixels considering the amount of complaints about it like overheating, network reception issues, battery life, after sales service etc.
If only you could get Vivo phones in the uk
I honestly don't get the hate. I just went on a Disney vacation with my base s24 and my girlfriend's Pixel 9 pro outclassed it in so many ways. Her camera is so much better (especially the telephoto) and her battery life was superb. I had to set up a routine to put my phone in power save at 30% to make it through the day.
I own a pixel 9 Pro, their reasons for it being ""phone of the year"" are laughable
Fuck consumers for complaining about a sub par product! 
 
(Pixel 7a owner here, the battery life is absolute trash and should auto exclude these phones from any award)
They were upping prices for like 3 years now. There goes their excuse to not use snapdragon anymore because of price.
More like everything except the processor is good and even then I have never had an issue with speed. It's one of the few phones that lets you relock the bootloader on a custom rom and gets 7 years of updates as well. I won't buy anything else.
On the contrary, the only thing I find decent about Pixel is photos (not video). Everything else, including software/UI, is meh at best.
Not even. The fact that they don't allow you to hide the navigation bar is a deal breaker for me.
try adding a new tile to the quick tiles... how is that good design? (ik its not a thing done often, but it just feels barebones and unfinished)
Well dunno about it. This was my thinking when I had Nexus, Pixel 3 phones. Brought Pixel 8A to my gf few weeks ago. It is so glitchy, unstable, lacking Basic functions compared to Samsung phones.
No the build is great. Feels so good in the hand, a lot like the iPhones. Battery life of fantastic too, and I use my phone all day for work. 


Camera is fucked though, that's all in the software, a recent update made some big improvements but it's got a ways to go

That should read Pixel 9 Pro XL
Agree. By far the best phone for the price in the US this year 
why?
I came from the S22+ after not buying Pixel since the 5 and while I don't hate the 9PXL, it's shocking to see how many of the complaints I had about the 5 that drove me away from Pixel have carried over through all these hardware iterations. Delayed notifications, terrible Bluetooth, group message issues, etc.  

I also kind of wish I held out for the S25.
Video Quality has been my biggest complaint with the pixels from the beginning! ""Best camera"" my ass. They're still fantastic with stills but I'm bummed to see that video never improved.
There's really a lot of good and bad between the two. If it weren't for my s22 ultra and 23 ultra pictures being a blurry mess of my moving kid,  I'd have stuck with Samsung also.

I do really like my pixel 9 pro xl, but Samsung does also have intriguing hardware and software.
>buggy 80% charge limit

What bugs are people facing? Seems to work as intended for me.
It's almost like 95% of people don't care about almost any of these things and just want a clean UI and smooth experience.
Desktop mode is coming, 80% charge limit is brand new, Android 16 will change quick settings UI, and (personally) lock screen widgets are a gimmick. Wanting a routines / shortcut app is valid though.
And no bloat and no ads, Pixel is still the best software experience by far
> buggy 80% charge limit

I see you've never tried Sony Xperia's *Battery Care* before, because I assure you - however bad Google's 80% charge limit is, [you've seen **nothing**](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1hbazh6/pixel_phones_now_support_bypass_charging_when_set/m1g2u1l/?context=3).

Yours truly had their Sony phone wake up to *1*% battery while connected to the charger over the past week.
Context?
Yeah this wasn't posted by him OR written by him.
r/Android user claiming MishaalRahman = Oliver Cragg:
I had literally nothing to do with this article. I didn't even participate in voting!
I also have a pixel 7. I liked it right up until about last summer. I'm not sure if it was an update that caused it or what, but the thing heats up all the time from basic things and is almost unusable outside in warm weather. I have a wireless charger for it in my car that has basically become useless, it will charge for a little while then get too hot and refuse to continue charging. I bought this because I had a Pixel 4xl, and I really did like the camera performance. However with all the issues I've been having, I can barely do that anymore. I was outside last summer, and would pull out the camera after doing nothing with the phone and it would struggle to open the camera app, then after I hit the shutter button it would have a noticeable delay before taking the picture. After this I'm pretty much done with the Pixel line if they stick with Tensor. It is a problem and they are refusing to accept that.
Counterpoint: I love my Pixel 9 Pro
Ur gonna get a lot of bad comments from bird brains. It's like saying you don't like your Tesla. I sold my trash but nobody listens
> Pixel is the Tesla of smartphones.

Lmao. This comparison doesn't even make a fucking modicum of sense. Pixel is *at worst* a Hyundai.

A phonemaker would have to be thoroughly terrible in every single way to be likened to Tesla, whose marquee feature is ""FSD"" that swerves its EVs straight into the wrong direction and drives full speed into opposing traffic - all to make a left turn.
This is objectively wrong
No they do not
Like me haha. But honestly I read on masse before purchase but after I stop reading about the particular model and more overall Google and Android stuff.
This.  
Unless they're in the USA and probably got at least 50% off or even got paid to upgrade their iPhone or Pixel 6... which seems to be a thing.
Build quality is phenomenal. It feels amazing in the hands. 
Battery life of stellar too.
Camera is fucked though. It does sound bad bad bad post processing. Even if you lost the exposure, after you take the photo it brightens it right back up. It's actually insane.
You're wrong, I have every iPhone ever made and I love the Pixel 9 Pro XL and it is the Best phone of 2024.
I think people kinda use them in 3-5 years too in the used market ""Oh i'll pick up a used Pixel 9 Pro since it got phone of the year instead of the Samsung"".  Apple users really don't factor; you're getting an iPhone.
Traded in a $200 OnePlus 8, got a $400 credit towards my Google Pixel 7 Pro, 3 years ago. Actually made money on that trade. 

Traded in that Pixel 7 Pro recently for an $800 credit on a $1000 Pixel 9 Pro XL. Effectively a $200 phone. $8.33 per month for two years on a carrier I have no intention of leaving because I also get internet through them for $25 per month.

Tell me again what expensive purchase I need to justify?
Funnily when I got a 7pro it was cheaper than I could have gotten a regular 7 for.   
It would have been the same for a 9 this upgrade too but I splurged for the fold
Yeah, 30bucks per month is such an insane expense.

You can literally deposit used bottles from trashcans and get 30bucks per month..
Did they actually fucking give the pixel 8 pro the prize? Nevermind that, the 6 too??
2020 was the Galaxy S20 FE!
I hear you lol. I asked it to navigate to a store somewhere nearby, a Michael's. It proceeds to direct me to a Michael's literally 3 hours away. No list of nearby Michael's to choose from, just sent me 3 hours away. 

Sick Google, great job.
I've asked it to set reminders multiple times. Each time it told me that the reminder has been set. 

Yet not once has it actually ever sent me a reminder.
You know what I want more than AI features? Notifications that don't get dozed because you haven't looked at your phone for 20 minutes. Even with all the battery optimisations and adaptive power and priority notifications etc tweaked, my P8Pro still takes 2-3 minutes to alert me that my ALSO GOOGLE doorbell has gone off, and sometimes won't alert me to whatsapps for up to 30 minutes. Yesterday I got a notification off my banking app 3 HOURS after a transaction had gone through. What if I'd had my wallet stolen and someone was using contactless on my card? 

Google phones have a huge delayed notification issue that's been going on for years, on the forum they pivot between 'looking into it's and 'its supposed to do that'
Yes, I said that I like the Pixel and that I turned Gemini off, but thanks for driving those points home!
I do think you can apply that to most upper midrange and flagship phones, though.
I'm very objective, I own a pixel, but i wouldn't consider it phone of the year, not with the ai stuff the samsing phones do... that's why I said it seems bought award
> At this point, I feel like these are existing to help people justify their expensive purchases ""yea that's right, I own smartphone of the year"".

Who are these people that need to justify their phone purchase? I've never met one in real life. I don't even know a single person who gives a shit about what phone someone else is using.
I was not talking about nintendo.
There were several news articles about how Pixel 9 is selling very well in US and has massively increased their market share.
I see a lot of Pixels here in Canada.
Aren't phone sales down all around right now? I'm still using my pixel 4 xl I bought shortly after it released. I still feel no need to get a new phone.
Brand loyalty and not caring enough about phones to switch from what they're familiar with.
Do people talk about this? I couldn't even tell you what phones my friends use
I have had 2 Pixels and they have been perfect. Currently running a Pixel 6 and it's running as good today as the day I bought it. I couldn't find a reason not to buy another Pixel when I need an update
Have you considered that, maybe, not everyone experiences the bugs, finds a glass and metal build to be ""shit"", or experiences bad signal? Clearly most reviewers don't because these phones get well reviewed almost every year.
People who are satisfied with their phones don't generally feel the need to run to reddit and talk about how satisfied and content they are.

Places like r/android are negativity echo chambers.
"" I don't get the hate. My gf's 1100€ smartphone outperforms my 600€ one in some areas"". 

Buddy, c'mon, for the same price you can buy an Oppo find x8 pro, a xiaomi 14 ultra, an s24 ultra, and all of them will be twice as fast.
> I just went on a Disney vacation with my base s24 and my girlfriend's Pixel 9 pro outclassed it in so many ways.

The Galaxy S24 launched at $799. The Pixel 9 Pro launched at $999. The S24 is the equivalent of the regular Pixel 9 price-wise, so yeah, it will be a better phone across the board.

> Her camera is so much better (especially the telephoto) and her battery life was superb. I had to set up a routine to put my phone in power save at 30% to make it through the day.

It would have better telephoto and ultrawide sensors in particular, since they're both larger sensors than the S24's, and the telephoto has greater reach. But that's part of why the phone costs $200 more than the S24. Equally, preferences in camera processing are subjective and varies based on what you're shooting.

The Pixel 9 Pro is closer in battery capacity to the S24+/Ultra than the regular S24, so naturally battery life would be much better.

Samsung only offers the Ultra in a single size, which is a shame. They need to do a smaller version of the Ultra to compete with the iPhone Pro, and it's good that Google offers this option.
I've got the pixel. Yeah the s24 doesn't have a 5x zoom so that's better. No way the photos look better though. The pixel desaturates everything and lightens the shadows to a weird degree
I'm not sure if you're aware, but your Pixel 7a is not a Pixel 9 Pro. What on earth guess your anecdotal situation have to do with this article? 
your phone is not phone of the year tho.


Its like saying ""i own cheapest samsung, and its slow. Galaxy ultra must be trash""
Yeah, I also have issues with my Pixel 8 (scroll stutter). Looking into the base S25 in January.
Yeah, I got one before I read everything about the processor, but I don't regret it because I've never had a single issue. If this sub hadn't told me the processor was bad, then I'd never have known.
Bad battery life, slow charging speed. Software good, hardware bad.
Nah, software is only appealing to Android ""purists"", it's lacking a lot of features. 

It's my perpetual backup phone because it simply doesn't have anything like Secure Folder.
I actually like the design of the Pixel experience software. OneUI (which is what I'm using right now), is hideous. But I can't live without Samsung's software features and superior hardware, or else I would've jumped to a Pixel already.
Sounds like a defective unit TBH. There's no way the 8a was any more glitchy than my 6a, which actually had very few glitches. It only got better over time software-wise, contrary to people who seem to think Pixels don't age well.

Google has their software down hard IMO. Pixel has been very smooth for me. Plus the UI is super clean.

If you're a gamer on the other hand then I don't think Pixel is what you want. But that's what I have 2 consoles at home for...
It feels like the same phone mostly, not enough of an upgrade. I liked the camera better on the six but that could because I put a protector on the 9s camera, the Bluetooth has some issues, and NFC card payments are hit and miss.

I will say, the 9 Pro's modem kicks ass! I get 1.3-5gbps down and 100-120mbps up
Same
[deleted]
The battery usage page is still based on ""last full charge"" but since the phone never reaches that, the info is inaccurate. 
You're not getting a smooth experience with the Pixel. The latest December update causes some stuttering sometimes, which makes zero sense since it happens when nothing is rendering either. Not sure what's up with that.
Yep they'd rather have ai gimmicks it seems. Instead of something practical that every other oem/ios already has.
Ik they'll eventually add things that other oems already have (basically what feature drops are... still waiting for auracast) but googles slow and behind imo.
Cue the ""Google apps are bloat"" comment
Do Pixels allow you to block tracking from apps/domains?
No but it was written by this guy

>  His first Android phone was the Google Nexus 4, and he’s still a **dedicated Google user** to this day
Yes me too! I wasn't even going to mention that because I was already getting ranty lol. My phone becomes *barely* usable on a warm day, which is like 10 months out the year where I am. 

It really takes me back to the old days rocking a Galaxy S2 in a poor-reception area.

The Pixel 9s have a new modem that apparently takes steps towards fixing the issue. But seems that reports are still pretty widespread regarding overheating.
Of course, it's a matter of taste, there are different people and they can have completely different tasks and visions of the ideal smartphone. Apparently, I'm just not part of the Pixel's target audience. I'm something of a geek and for some reason I thought that the Pixel would suit me. Although now I understand that Google positions its devices as a competitor to the iPhone, and is targeting the corresponding audience. Although, to be fair, much of what worries me relates to quite mundane functions.
I haven't really shared this with anyone, and I want to speak out, so I hope you don't mind if I grumble a little. At the same time, we'll find out how much the pixel has changed over the past 2 generations.

The first thing I noticed was high battery consumption when idle. I quickly determined the cause, it was in the radio module. After googling a bit, I discovered that this is a hardware problem and has been haunting Pixels for a long time and for some reason is not fixed. Recently in the news I came across information that the Pixel 10 will be equipped with a modem from Mediatek, it will be interesting to know how things will be with it.

The second thing that worries me is the lack of media functions that I have long been accustomed to when using smartphones of other brands. Pixel pro of my generation does not have DolbyVision, the USB port does not support HDMI and DP, and screen mirroring is only available on devices equipped with Chromecast (as it turns out, my projectors and TVs do not have it). 
All this is accompanied by low quality of built-in speakers, making the consumption of multimedia content on a device with a premium price rather unpleasant pastime.

Another discovery for me was that Android on Pixel does not have the ability to ""freeze""/""block"" an app, that is, prevent the system from turning it off in the background. This feature has been available on almost all other manufacturers for probably more than a decade, but here the system constantly closes the apps I need so much, despite a fairly impressive amount of RAM.

Horrible throttling, with an already very weak SoC. This smartphone really lacks performance. Even if compared with outsiders like MediaTek of the same generation. Subjectively, the SoC in the Pixel 7 pro is many times weaker than the Dimensity. 

Throttling even affected charging! The charging power of my Pixel is only 22W, which is already very little, but as soon as the phone is used even minimally, the power drops to 7W! This really pisses me off. The phone is quite a power-hungry one despite the aggressive mechanism for turning off apps in the background and throttling, and it also takes forever to charge! 

But most of all, the phone heats up because of a faulty modem. It is enough to download something at high speed and you are guaranteed to have your smartphone go into safe mode with a warning about overheating. At this point, throttling makes it impossible to use the smartphone at all, it stops performing even the simplest functions, even typing becomes impossible.

I haven't encountered issues like slow fingerprint, voice calls and SMS issues as I don't use these features but I have come across posts on this topic.

I encounter various software bugs daily and hourly, but I don't think it's reasonable to complain about them, since I participate in the beta testing program. But even using the latest version of Android, I feel that Google is in a catch-up position, since it introduces features into its version of Android that have long existed in other manufacturers.


I'm not sure I could remember all the problems I encountered, but these are enough to conclude that Google is aiming for the premium league, but so far has only mastered the marketing of its devices.


The review would be incomplete if I didn't mention the pros, wouldn't it? But there aren't any. Everything Google offers is already available elsewhere. Even the circle to search feature I love so much is no longer exclusive and is being introduced to competitors' devices. Otherwise, Google gave me only bitterness and disappointment. Even if you don't take into account such a high price, the device turned out to be very raw and unbalanced, completely not corresponding to the status of a flagship. All the previous smartphones that I had were literally better than what I have now.

How are things going with the Pixel 9 pro? Is everything as rosy as the magazine articles say?
You are exhausting
Oh yea same here haha. I've only owned Pixels all my life, but I sure do know a lot about other phones lol. Sometimes I know more about a user's phone than them and I don't even have the phone haha. Just our own little hobbies and interests.
So if i am in Poland should i buy a samsung A55 instead of pixel8a? They are the same price of about 430 dollars
I live in Canada and was on a contract that cost me a little over $90 per month and I had a Samsung Galaxy s10e. I went into Rogers on Black Friday and managed to get the pixel 9 pro for free on a contract that only cost me $55 a month and I got way more data than I had before.

The fact that they had the pro version in a compact phone was what sold me on switching back to Google. I'm not a fan of those huge phones that seem to be all the rage these days. If the pro version had been the size of the XL one I would have just gone for the Samsung Galaxy s24.
I pay 11 Canadian shillings per month for mine.

That's $183 US over 2 years, after which I have the option of returning the phone or paying the remaining $220 US to own it outright.
I believe the camera issue was actually a bug with the recent Gcam 9.6. It was actually fine on release with version 9.5 and I think the newest 9.7 update fixes it.

I also don't disagree, I was more just taking a jab at pixel users as one myself haha. I still do prefer boxier designs, but damn does the Pixel 9 really feel premium in the hands. It's really hard to explain that to others until they actually hold it.
Battery life is stellar? Compared to what? Your old phone?
I was more poking jabs haha. I love my Pixel 9 as well. Been a pixel user since the first 1 and Pixel's Android is my favorite mobile OS.

My mother uses an iPhone 15 Pro Max and honestly I can even appreciate that craftsmanship. I just really don't like iOS at the end of the day.
Mate you got very defensive about your phone over my joke. I'm a Pixel 9 owner myself.
Got your panties in a twist? I'm just poking some jabs. I'm a Pixel 9 owner myself lol.

That being said, it's like 30/month for 3 years. No one wants to pick up used bottles of the streets for that long.
Lol, that's probably why it's been scrubbed.
Regular assistant was great at doing that one long before Gemini 

Especially if you were using Android Auto. Take me to McDonald's! Ok here's a random one 8.5 hours away!
Haha, I've been a Pixel user since the 1. If anything, I think the 9 non-pro is more deserving of the award for its price to performance.

Is there currently AI stuff Samsung can do that Pixels can't? They both seem to be pretty much the same regarding that area, just different names for the same/similar tech.
The Samsung Phone AI stuff is literally same stuff from Google, what are you on about? O.o
Anecdotal. I've met some folks who really cares about phones. Not necessarily what phones others are using (in the US, it's majority iPhones anyways), but they do care about seeing some rare phones in public or whatever.

I remember being on the train and my buddy pointing out a OnePlus 2 in public and I thought that was pretty interesting as well. To this day, it's still the only OnePlus I've seen in public.
Really? I mean really??? You don't feel the need to get a new phone?

Pixel 4 XLs battery was a piece of shit back in 2019 and i can only imagine how bad it got. Not to mention the whole Soli gimmick (if you weren't region locked and it wasn't grayed out lmao) was draining battery even when disabled (or not available) for some reason. 

Worst pixel i ever owned, sold it after 3 months.
People tend to only talk about something if they love it or have an issue.
[deleted]
He's not talking about speed, at least Google has a smaller pro phone, there's no smaller ultra phone
I use an iPhone 16PM and Pixel 9 pro XL daily. I honestly can't tell the difference as far as speed. The Pixel is super smooth and responsive.
Her phone was cheaper than mine!! She got her phone for $302.49 after trading in her old iPhone 12 to T-Mobile. Plus as someone else mentioned at least Google offers their flagship cameras on the smaller phone.
Can confirm, 14 ultra camera seems ok
0.1% of smartphone users even notice ""speed"" now.

 Technology is to the point where any decent midrange device and up will have no noticeable slowdowns to anyone except for people explicitly looking for it, which you are one of potentially dozens.
Had a Pixel 8 Pro that was even worse (returned after 2 weeks of use). 
 
If 2 anecdotes are not enough, go check the Pixel subreddit for other complaints. 
 
And I was very clearly replying to a comment implying people love to randomly hate on the pixel. Reading comprehension is hard, I know.
It does now
Private Space
It doesn't deserve the praise reviewers seem to give it imo. you literally have to manually drag a tile all the way up a long list to add it, instead of a simple + button.  (they're changing this in a16 apparently, to be more like OneUI/Nothing)
I have a 6 pro right now and I'm considering it. Main things I want are better battery, selfie cam, screen brightness and better modem. I think I can swing it. Thanks for sharing though.

Did you go for the pro or pro XL btw?
im calling cap, iphone sub and pixel sub are much worse
You've not been to other tech subreddits before, have you?
Thanks! Honesty seems more like an issue with the battery usage page not being updated to recognize the 80% charge limit.
>The battery usage page is still based on ""last full charge"" but since the phone never reaches that, the info is inaccurate. 

What's the issue? Does it show usage since the last time it was at 100% charge?  
If so, then it sounds like the feature is working as intended. 80% is not a ""full charge"" so it should not reset.
Yeah I mean all things running software are going to have bugs. I'm not gonna sit here and claim every Pixel in the world is 100% smooth 100% of the time.

All my original comment was meant to indicate is that the vast majority of people do not care about most of the (Samsung) features they mentioned (e.g. desktop mode, floating windows, etc).
Yep, my old S22 that I sold was smoother than my Pixel 8, that's for sure.
Not saying Pixels don't have their deficiencies but the vast majority of people do not care or even think about things like desktop mode or floating windows.

It's nice that Samsung phones have those features for power users but you need to be realistic that it's probably not going to win them awards like this.
> googles slow and behind imo

While we all watch as [Samsung copies Apple](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1e15g2r/samsung_criticized_for_cloning_apple_products/) while [continuing to utterly half-ass said photocopy](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1hgd27r/chunvn8888_i_can_confirm_galaxy_s25_series_will/). Slow and behind indeed.
I agree they're slow, though it's better than them releasing cool features and then having them disappear after a year because Google lol
First party apps aren't bloat... goes for all oems and ios.
So? These are opinion pieces for a site based on android, Of course they prefer android...
hello, ""this guy"" here. our EC award is based on voting by our senior reviewers and editors so it's not just my pick, as noted in the article (FWIW I actually voted the XL top and was also gunning for the Razr/S24 FE, too).
Pixels can be as simple or as complicated as you want. They are one of the few phones sold in the US that allow you to unlock the bootloader which means you can flash whatever you want on them 
Tldr: everything bad nothing good. Complete utter trash, completely useless. 

Ok
Cry harder, Elon Musk fanboy. Say hello to rcnfive on youre way out.
I wouldn't even consider myself a phone hobbyist and I know more about people's phones than they do lmao. Half the time it creeps them out
Well, the camera will be significantly more arse on A55/A54 and it'll be less smooth in UI. So it's up to you if you think that paper specs and Samsung features are worth the tradeoff.
A55 is a much bigger phone if you're okay with that why not.. Should have a good sale price on Boxing day?
Save $100 and get A54. Same specs. A55 has a worse processor.
Mind sharing how and where you get such a price? What are the plan costs on top of the phone financing costs? 

Looking to upgrade from my aging Huawei P30 Pro, which I bought for the camera. From what I am gathering the cameras on the new Pixel are at least on par, but super macro seems to be much better on the P30.
""Hey Google... Never mind ""

""Nevermind was Nirvana's sixth studio album released in 1991...."" 

WHY
I got pixel 9 for $300. I feel like this is a pretty sweet deal. But I'm still debating if i should trade it in for op13 when it comes out.
I have seen my girlfriend use the ai translator in her s24 ultra at a Pakistani restaurant and translated everything the server and cook were arguing about. I tried on my pixel and it wouldn't get all of it, or gave weird context, bad sentence structure and I for sure know that the cook did not say he was gay.
Agreed,  I would need to know why the Pixel over a Sammy it's basically the phone minus the UI.  One could also argue which UI is better but one UI has come a long way.  I guess I should read the article.  I traded in my S24 Plus for a Pixel 9 Pro XL and honestly like the form factor more on the S24.  I think you are right in a regular Pixel 9 seems to be a better candidate to me at this point.
I don't use facial unlock and replaced the battery a couple years back.

the lidar thing definitely taught me not to make purchases based on future promises though!
>You literally said EVERYONE loves them outside this sub.

Oh my apologies, I didn't realize you wanted to get into arguments over pedantic word choices like children on a playground. 

A better way of putting it is, ""The *vast* majority of coverage I've seen outside of subreddits like r/android and r/googlepixel, have come to the conclusion that these devices are great value for the needs of most consumers"". That doesn't quite roll off the tounge like ""everyone outside this sub seems to love them"" though does it?

If *you personally* had a bad experience with your phone, then who am I to say that wasn't valid? But you also need to realize that your personal experience isn't the definitive experience that everyone else had. If everyone else experienced issues with signal, with the OS, or with the build, or with other things that make them so ""shit"" as you like to put it, then perhaps that would end up in some of the coverage of these devices like we saw when people had software bugs with the Pixel 6?

Or maybe, *just maybe* most people didn't experience those issues?

Also just a side note, the fuck are you talking about with scratches?

>if you were trying to rock the phone without a case and screen protector, after 4 months your phone would look horrible, scratches all over the screen and the metal part around the cameras. I have been using my phones without case+screen protector for the past 10 years, and not even one came close to looking like the Pixel. For comparison, my current phone , an s23u , after 1 year, looks flawless

We can literally look at the spec sheets for these devices and see the specific types of glass and metals in use, and they all use identical materials (latest gorilla glass for the generation, aluminum frames, titanium if it's a pro iphone). Quit talking out of your ass.
I know he isn't. But I am. The 1100€ google pixel is slower than phones that cost half its price, let alone ones in its class. And that makes it unacceptable by itself. 


And every. single. aspect of all of those phones I've listed is dramatically superior.

*  main camera
* telephoto 
* performance 
* battery life
* charging speed

It's like they're trying to be an iPhone but somehow still manage to have shittier hardware (and software). There is no point in buying one. 

""Phone of the year"" ~~they~~ 🤑💶 said
Vivo X200 Pro Mini, if it's available in your country.
""Good enough"" is not worth 1100€. Yeah, try again in 2-3 years. Or really just do anything intensive with it. OS smoothness isn't everything.
That's not what ""being cheaper"" means. 

The pixel 9, equivelent to the s24, doesn't even have a telephoto...
While it's definitely not the majority, I'd imagine on a global scale more than 0.1% of smartphone users play games on their phone, and if you play games, the difference in performance from the Pixel to its competition in that price range (devices with Snapdragon 8 Elite, Dimensity 9400), is pretty big and immediately noticeable.
I would argue otherwise. What the average user wants out of their phones is a smooth and reliable experience for years to come. Why would that person buy a pixel over the iphone?

Then why should that average consumer pay over 1000 for a phone with midrange performance? Give me a break, I'm telling my opinion here and obviously I'm not an average user.

Edit: bro blocked me 😭. Ah, pixel fanboys trying to justify paying ultra-premium prices for awful hardware. What else?

Edit 2: since I can't reply to this conversation, I'll just have to do it this way again to the comment below mine. 

My dude, everyone I talk to irl likes or hates their phone because it slowed down over the years considerably, or because they overheat with basic tasks. The pixel will do fine today, but still feels worse and heats up more than the competition. But good luck selling it to the average user who plans to keep it for a long time. Everyone is getting rid of their iPhone 11 for a reason. The machine perfectly capable of running tiktoks is slower than usual. And if that happened with the fastest soc in the market at the time and arguably the best optimization, just imagine how badly the pixel will run.
I like to think that too, but after 2 years with a pixel 7 I am noticing. This thing gets hot and then the photo app, which was the reason I chose this phone, will slow down. It was very noticable last summer and I'm not happy about it
I bought a new one because Outlook was slow for me. Not gonna wait 0.5-1.0 seconds to switch from Focused inbox to Other
The Pixel 8 pro is also not a Pixel 9 pro. You're closer! 
I came from Pixel 4,,5,7 pro and now 9 pro. The 9 pro battery life isan amazing improvement from the rest.
No no no you don't get it, every year before this one google fucked up their phones, but trust me, pinky finger, this year it's actually decent. Yeah sure.
> As expected, this triggered the salty Pixel haters.

>> you: Fuck consumers for complaining about a sub par product!  
then writes about his shitty P7a

>>> your Pixel 7a is not a Pixel 9 Pro

>>>> you: Had a Pixel 8 Pro that was even worse (returned after 2 weeks of use).

It's like watching Marjorie Taylor Greene whine about government oppression over potatocam videos of ""drones"" in New Jersey. Youre so close to getting it.
I got the pro. I was looking forward to and appreciate the smaller device. It's almost unnoticeable in my pocket
oh whoops I thought I was in /r/GooglePixel. Whoops
Aka a bug related to the 80% implementation.

If you introduce something and it broke other features, it's the new thing's fault.
The page should account for the fact that max will be 80%... [makes SOT unclear.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1h9yff5/battery_usage_never_resetting_with_80_charge_limit/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
fair, but even lockscreen customization is pathetic compared to iOS. Not to mention you cant even dim the flashlight without installing an app.
Yep a bunch of things are blatantly copied but I'd rather have a stock routines app, background remove in photos and better lockscreen customization than not.... other features that I mentioned weren't copied from apple (dual blutooth, auracast, desktop mode, floating windows). The news from the second link u sent isn't great but I'd rather have the magnets in the case anyways. (I even use it like that with the iPhone). 
They are referring to Google hardware.
I'm more concerned about hardware issues than software ones.
Besides, I stopped unlocking the bootloader on my smartphones for probably a decade now. The smartphone has become a significant part of my life and I don't want to risk reducing security.
I think by definition, that makes you a phone hobbyist lol. I mean the fact that we're even commenting on /r/Android is a step up from your average joe haha. I think sometimes we just kinda hive mind on reddit a bit and forget the real world is pretty different.
Isn't it the other way round? A54 throttled a lot. A55 is quite stable at sustained loads.
Freedom Mobile as long as you're in Canada. They have the phone for the same price on Boxing Day deals.

It's $11 + $45 for 75GB data that works in Canada, US, Mexico, plus 10GB in basically the rest of the world. $56/month + tax total.

The Pro XL is $16/month.
Does anyone have it say ""Ayyyee gah!"" when you dictate a text to Android Auto. I can't figure out what it's trying to say and it's existed for years with multiple phones for me.
9 Pro 256GB for $328. Literally the only reason I upgraded, otherwise I saw no value proposition over my Pixel 8.
Ahh gotcha, so the reliability is better. Honestly I can see that. It might also depend on the language.

I have translate set up for my dad's pixel and he uses it to translate everything back to Vietnamese and he's never expressed issues with it.
As an owner of the P9, I actually love the boxy design of the Pixel 6 and S24 Ultra much more. And you're right that OneUI has improved a lot over the years, especially from TouchWiz lol. But I still feel like it's slightly bloated Android at times. Pixels have a ""stock"" feeling about them that I can never seem to shake. But to each their own, I understand that this is a very nuanced take from my own perspective.
It's only on subs like this where people will genuinely complain about android phone SOC speeds *still*, in 2024. Phone chips have been so overkill for so long we're at the point where they're rivaling most laptops in terms of speed, and yet they're still somehow too slow for some of y'all.

You have an S21 FE listed in your flair, do you find *that* phone to be too slow? I'd hope not, because it's still a really nice phone! But in benchmarks it performs worse than *a Pixel 6*, let alone the 7, 8, or 9.

As for everything else you've listed, we have reviews for that for a reason, and Pixel 9 or 9 pro is getting good reviews *for a reason*.
> The 1100€ google pixel is slower than phones that cost half its price, let alone ones in its class.

At least half the phones available in youre neck of woods that you claim are better than the P9P simply won't work in the US except for T-Mobile and its MVNOs due to carrier whitelisting.

> There is no point in buying one.

If youre aim is to sway the other guy into usnig a vivo or xiaomi, congrats, it's not very effective... coming from the user with a S21FE no less. I'm just gonna chalk this one up to ""Apple_The_Chicken has **no fucking clue** what he's talking about, still believing that paper specs are more important than actual user experiences"".
It's not
>>""Good enough"" is not worth 1100€. Yeah, try again in 2-3 years.

My pixel 6 remains plenty fine, thanks. I even keep it as work phone after getiing p9p
>Or really just do anything intensive with it

What do you find to be intensive? I may not play call of duty or the next gacha game, but I have done editing of videos and everything has been very smooth. Not everyone needs a phone that can play Nintendo switch games or computer games on winlater. 

My pixel 9 pro Xl runs just as smooth as my old Samsung  phone. No jank. Does about the same thing with games, but I don't need intensive games, I needed a camera that could take photos of people in motion.

Since I live in the US... It's Samsung, OnePlus, apple or Google. Out of the android phones I chose a pixel because it's camera and software is better imo.
Then why aren't you using a Xiaomi 14 Ultra instead of youre current waifu shit S21FE? [**You even said it youreself**](https://old.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/comments/1gzlim3/s24_ultra_definitely/lz0sk9s/?context=3): 

> At this point, no one should ever spend this much on a samsung ultra with all the competition coming from China.

That makes youre ITT mention of 

>>> Buddy, c'mon, for the same price you can buy an Oppo find x8 pro, a xiaomi 14 ultra, an **s24 ultra**, and all of them will be twice as fast.

even more ironic.
What's the Samsung equivalent to the pixel 9 pro then? Apple has one...
[removed]
The average consumer will buy whatever they like and it's definitely better than midrange performance. You don't have to like it. 

Speed is a mostly irrelevant factor when comparing modern smartphones.

You clearly don't value what a P9 Pro has to offer for its price, but you're getting upset at the idea of anyone buying it which is silly.
I came from the future to tell you the Pixel 10 Pro is horrible.
 I'm from the future and I have pixel 18 pro, can I hate on it here or no?
Except the phones are in people's hands and we already have real-world usage info on them and battery life is good, the phones are good.
The 80% charge limit feature works fine, it keeps your phone from going over 80% while charging, as its description describes. It's just not being considered as a ""full charge"" by the battery usage page and technically it isn't a ""full charge."" 

For me, calling the 80% charging limit ""buggy"" implies that there's some problem with the actual feature limiting the charge to 80%, but I can see where you're coming from.
ikr... lotta ppl shilling for midrange phones with fewer features disguised as flagships.
My first Google device was a Nexus one, then a galaxy s2 skyrocket, then a galaxy Nexus, then a Nexus 4, then a Nexus 6p, then a pixel Xl, Galaxy Note 9, Fold 3, Fold 4, S22 Ultra and now a Pixel 9 Pro Xl.

Id say I'm still a dedicated Google hardware fan, but I also love Samsung, if it weren't for the cameras motion shots being blurry on my S22 Ultra, I probably would've stayed on Samsung. BUT, the camera and some of the software things make me really enjoy using a pixel again. There's still things that bother me about Pixel software, like not being able to force full screen on all apps, but I still LOVE this phone way more than my S22 Ultra. Maybe because I like the auto tinting or it just working. Who knows, but when I needed a phone with a better camera I chose the Pixel 9 Pro which makes it my preferred pick of the year.
I mean you're not wrong lol. I'd say I'm more a tech enthusiast and phones fall under that umbrella. I've worked in tech for a decade, love to tinker, and am impressed by specs. Considering phones support all that I'm interested in them lol
Makes sense that a worse processor would run cooler.
I am in Canada and was looking just now. It shows me $30 for the phone (256GB) with the $45/75GB plan as the cheapest option. 

Or did you opt to give the phone back after 2 years?
Where did u get it for $328?
> 9 Pro 256GB for $328

god damn it is 1,142.68 United States Dollar here in Poland, where minimum wage is 6$/hour
Yes, I find it extremely slow and I hate it every day. Not good enough for me.
Dude I have had this account since I was 12 I can't change the username now.... ""apple"" has nothing to with apple. 

* the US is not the centre of the fucking world. I'm talking about Europe and all of those phones are available here. 


I'm just gonna chalk this one to ""pixel fanboy pretends Google has ever had a good track record when it comes to experience, despite receiving the worst reviews and complaints every single year, with the least stable android version"". You just pretend the overheating pile of mess Google calls ""tensor"" is anywhere close to being ""good"". It's ""ok"", it'll work ""smoothly"" for a while, but so will every other midranger. You just choose to ignore the fact that r/Googlepixel is the only brand-specific subreddit to have more complaints than good reviews. 

Or that you just see ""Chinese phone"" and automatically assume the software is going to be bad/unstable. You know what, xiaomi might be, but Oppo clearly fucking isn't, their software is leagues and bounds over everyone else's when it comes to stability (spoiler alert: no one cares about AI). The camera specs are not only better, but the software processing is too. Samsung is extremely stable too, their app ecosystem is much better than Google's, and the featire-set actually resembles an Android. You just all live in a buble, I guess, unwilling to try new things. 


Yeah, I hate this s21. I paid 400 for it though, quite worth it overall. The specs clearly matter... specially when you're paying 1100€ for one. Yeah, I want to do whatever I want with my phone without it overheating. Yes, I want to play games and run emulators. Yes, I want it to last for years to come. And yes, I absolutely want a decent camera, which the pixel is not, from which I can take advantage of using the pro mode, which the pixel doesn't even fucking have (how disgraceful).
The fucking Kirin SOCs from Huawei are sanctioned away from using half of the world's components yet they still compete with the Pixel. That's how shitty Tensor is.
the Pixel 6 was terrible when it launched, at least when it came to stability, battery life and thermals. I have no idea how much they've improved, but the new tensor SOC on these new Pixel 9 is terribly behind the competition, much more so than the Pixel 6. At least it has 12GB of RAM. I don't have much hope for the 8GB s24 either, knowing samsung, but at least it's relatively cheap and midrange priced.
""Running as smooth as an s22u"" is not a flex. At all. It's not that smooth. I've tried it. Both the xiaomi and the oppo feel much faster, samsung feels considerably worse.

By intensive I mean, yes, playing games, or really just video recording for a long time and expecting your phone to be perfectly smooth and not boiling hot afterwards. 


I guess there's no reason to *hate* the Pixel 9P. It's an OK phone, just not one I would pay over 1000 for. 

For that, I want at least a double telephoto array + 1 inch main camera sensor + decent performance down the road + 512GB. The xiaomi 14U does that, ig it would be the perfect phone for me if it its battery life were better. I can't justify buying a samsung either, the camera hardware is 3y old and the processing is horrible.
Because clearly I didn't buy the s21 today, I bought a mid-ranger phone for 400€ (the xiaomi costs around  €1100) 3 years ago, which has served me decently, at a time oppo was banned from selling phones in Europe and Xiaomi smartphones still kinda sucked next to Samsung's. 

Clearly today I won't buy another Samsung ultra phone, despite finding the pen extremely useful. 

I'm only a student, I have money for the xiaomi, but I need to buy a macbook too and I wouldn't want to erase half of my savings on these two. So for now I will keep using my s21fe, knowing full well I didn't ever consider a pixel for a good reason.
Did you just call me a fucking gypsy? How random LMAO
It does not exist in that size. The closest equivelent is the S24 Ultra, which costs the same.

The s24 costs much less. Faster, worse camera and different telephoto focal length (tbh I prefer the 3x over the 6x). And given the new exynos modem on the pixel 9 (absent from the exynos s24), I'm guessing the battery is better too.

I mean that is only marginally more than it is here. I just got 30% off through Google Play and a $490 trade in. Federal minimum wage is $7.25/hr.
So you're just trolling. Got it.
Oh? How much faster can they go through menus? Like what the fuck are you basing this on? You can change how fast the screen animations are and it can FLY also.

So, for an average person, they should recommend the high end processor phones so they can play solitaire or balatro? 

As for video I've had no issues with my pro XL, of course I'm not shooting a movie, but like 5 minutes videoing with no issues at all. I guess I'm wondering what kinda video are you making?

As for performance down the road, my mother in law is still rocking a pixel 3a and loves it.  What performance issues are you expecting?

I just don't understand your entire rant, other than price, which makes sense to me, other than everyone is pricing their phones around the same amount for these screen sizes.
The pixel 18 pro is also not the pixel 9 pro. You’re getting further!
They gave you 300+ for your p8?
If it had 8GB, then maybe. But it doesn't, it has 6GB and it's a pain in the ass to use. Plus, whenever the phone overheats things slow down a lot, a common complaint with the tensor line.

Edit: 

Another one that blocked me over an argument. 

Sorry dude, if someone buys an ultra/pro phone to browse reddit all day, then that person is a moron. 

But if that person buys a ultra/pro phone price-wise with midrange specs to browse reddit anyways, then that dude really is a MASSIVE fucking moron.

But yet you choose to call ME stupid because I actually use the functions on said phone? And yeah, mine sucks because it is not good enough for what """"""I"""""" need, not you, dumbass.
* that pixel runs on snapdragon

Mate, stop lying to yourselves, the outdated machine google sells for 800€, which barely competes with the sanctioned kirin SOC from Huawei, can't run an emulator, can't play games, and genuinely takes time to do things (as reported by their users), and, funnily enough, can't even run Firefox decently 🤣. Cry me a river, this shit is not worth 1000€ when the likes of the SD 8 Elite are out. Genuinely a scam. At least apple's phones are reliable and fast.

Many such reports on r/samsung complaing about the s22, which are all very similar to my experience with the s21fe. Extreme overheating, slowdowns (especially when using the camera), high shutter lag, video lag. Genuinely the worst phone from Samsung ever. I'm telling you, my friend's S10 runs better than my s21fe. What a difference a good soc makes. It doesn't even need to be fast as long as it doesn't overheat with basic tasks. Unfortunately, the SD 888, 8 gen 1 and the tensor are slow and hot. What a mess. Obviously, the fault lies with Samsung Foundry. No wonder they're begging for clients to even consider them.
No, $490

https://i.imgur.com/oeRGu8T.png
If you're genuinely not trolling then you're just unfathomably stupid. 

Have a good day!
Thats nice. Its good they are willing to offer that much for the trade in.
Google cheaping out on you. Samsung gave me more for the s21 ultra.
Honestly I don't really care about the phone. It's nice having a Pro in a ""smaller"" form factor. But I figured if I get at least $350 towards a 11 or even a 12 for another upgrade, this upgrade would pay for itself.
It's more than I paid for it, so I don't really care all that much. If it wasn't, and I didn't get a new one for $330 then I wouldn't have upgraded. I don't need a phone every year, just need a good value proposition and this was it. Getting more for a phone a don't want doesn't benefit me much does it?
U won't believe it but I went from op6 to pixel 9. I don't see much difference, heck I play with my wife's s23 and feel the same way. If it wasn't for op6 bad battery ( yes ive replaced it with two ""new"" batteries and both were the same if not worse than my original battery) and camera I would not see a reason for an upgrade.
Fair enough, I was talking about more through the lens of Google being one of the richest companies on the planet and manufacturing these phones which cost way more than what their feature set is worth, and their trade-in deal heavily favors them because we both know they're just going to resell these phones for much more, meanwhile one of the shadiest and most powerful companies in the world, Samsung gives a better deal
Yeah this is pretty much where I've been. I updated from my Pixel 5 only because of the battery to the Pixel 7. Hated the size so I upgrade to the Pixel 8 because it was smaller. The only reason I'm not upgrading again is because Google gave me more than I paid for the 8 for the trade-in and the cost of the 9 Pro ended up being so low.
They gave me 49% of the MSRP of the device after a year. The MSRP that I didn't even pay. My wife got an even better trade in on her 4 year old iPhone when upgrading, would that sway you away from Samsung? I bet it wouldn't. So again, I'm not sure what argument you are trying to make. I don't need to be unhappy with what I have because someone else has it better.
The iPhone deal depends, but that would be interesting",2024-12-18 16:00:58,560,280,https://www.androidauthority.com/best-phone-2024-editors-choice-android-authority-3507893/
Android,Exclusive: Pixel 9a Specs Confirmed - All the Details!,"

Comments:
Anyone know if this the same ultrasonic fingerprint sensor as the 9?
If only they had given the 9a the new modem, coulda been a great device but same modem as pixel 8 series, people might as well get 8 or maybe you could even get the 8 pro by the time 9a launches for the same price....
I wish they kept a smaller screen size for the A series. I loved my 4a but just recently got rid of it due to hardware issues. I ""upgraded"" to the 8 but miss the headphone jack, unlimited photo backup, and the rear fingerprint reader!
Had my Pixel 9 Pro less than a month but so far I'm unimpressed with the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. A screen protector clearly interferes with its accuracy, and this is *after* I turned off adaptive touch, and turned on screen protector mode. Face unlock is more reliable even still. 

Sometimes I think they just need to go back to the scanner on the back of the phone. It was superior.
so it will have a bigger battery than the s25 ultra lol
People complain way too much. Nothing wrong with pixels apart from the older ones with the G2 that would overheat.

Been with the Nexus lineup & pixel for years & I'm glad I did. 
Can't stand bloat or skins & Pixel phones are great for people who prefer practicality or see their phones as a utility.

Good screens, camera decent storage at the base model w 128gb same processor as their non A series just underclocked. What more do people want? Seriously just get whatever is cheaper between the 8-9 series especially when the regular 9 goes on sale.

Rant over lol

(Edit) Personally I'll wait for the 10 series as I already have a 4a & 8a & yes I use both daily. That alone is a testament to how good & underrated Pixels are.

It's not all about faster & faster now it's increasingly becoming more optimized & with more AI stuff being done on your phone itself.
What is the obsession with making everything bigger?
Does this mean we can expect deeper discounts on the 8a soon?
Charging speeds a little better
The main camera is a downgrade compared to the 8a. Smaller sensor (1/1.73"" on the 8a vs 1/2"" on the 9a). 

The phone is too big. 6.3"" is too much. Who is asking for all these gigantic phones? 

The 8a looks like a better deal. You are not going to tell the difference between the Tensor G3 and the Tensor G4. [I went from the 4a to the 8a](https://old.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1h3nag8/went_from_pixel_4a_to_pixel_8a_here_are_my/) and the speed difference between them is pretty much imperceptible in every day tasks.
Boring
Shocking
No
Is ultrasonic fingerprint scanner super costly? I only see it in flagship phones. Is there even a mid range phone with such scanner?
obviously not
Every year everyone talks shit about the Pixel modem with the ""new one"" being better than the one before it.
Strange it's taking them so long. Kind of embarrassing
Not me. I'll take a bigger battery any day.
The same


It was good years when we could buy such small phones as 4a
I finally had to give up my Pixel 3 for a 9, and I really wish this phone still had the back scanner. 
Bigger than its bigger brother as well, the 9Pro XL
Because big phones are what the people want.

The people who constantly scream for small phones are just a really vocal minority. A tiny minority. 

Companies cater to customer demand. If there were actually a lot of sales for smaller phones, the companies would gladly continue making them. Unfortunately that's not the case clearly.
Same reason why people are buying suvs instead of sedans. They want things bigger.
That's the same sensor used on Samsung A35 and it's only average. So many ~1/2"" sensor like sony's imx882/lyt600 are now on budget phones for around half the price. 9A's $499 for 128GB of ufs3.1 storage has to be one of the poorest hardware value of any recent phone
Exactly why I won't be upgrading my 6a. It's pointless.
Literally the entirety of the market. You are a very vocal minority.
[deleted]
Oh you're not local huh
They could just make them sightly thicker to compensate but large phones sell
A battery bigger than the regular 9 at that. I wonder if it will have better run time than the 9.  It's a pretty substantial jump in size
Is 6.3 inches considered a big phone?

Because I don't want a screen bigger than the 9 pro. Totally unnecessary.
Every major base flagship is on the smaller end   

iPhone 16(+pro), S24, Pixel 9(+pro) even Xiaomi 14 & Vivo X200PM, there's a very deliberate scarcity pricing/demand strategy
Personally I wouldn't be happy to pay Snapdragon prices for dung.  But that's just me.  I got my 6a for $150, it's been fantastic phone for that price.
There are rumors about an iPhone Air or whatever. I don't think they will sadly enough 🤕
6.3 is the new compact  

6.7 is average 

6.9 is big

Since the pixel 9 and 9a are now 6.3 and s24 is 6.2, iphone 16 is still the only truly compact flagship at 6.1 inches.
Smaller compared to their larger counterparts, but they aren't exactly small phones. It's big and bigger and that's essentially what the market wants. Apple sells phones like no one else and they had to discontinue their own, actual small phone bc no one was buying it.
Fantastic phone, yes.... Till it's modem ditches the signal in the middle of nowhere
[deleted]
I will gladly hold onto a phone this size for as long as possible. It's just unreasonable to ask me to get something bigger. I can still do some things one-handed if I want to. It's still reasonable to stick it in my back pocket while I'm up walking around.

Anything bigger is for folks with hands larger than mine. If I want a bigger screen, I've got a laptop...
6""1 today is like 5""4 of old because of of bezel. Most people online in 2024 talking about compact phones refer to 6.1"" range which absolutely do sell. Sure there's some who want actual 5"" phone like unihertz jellystar, but that's their own niche crowd
>but priced like exynos/tensor

No it is not. It's just slightly cheaper than its Qualcomm counterpart.
That's not even remotely true. The overall length of the phone may be similar to older models in part because bezels have gotten slimmer, but 6""+ isn't compact and the market doesn't agree that it's compact. Saying ""most people mean this when talking about compact phones"" means nothing bc we can't verify that, but what we can see is that there is a very clear market trend of screen sizes becoming bigger and then oscillating between 6.1-6.3"" as standard phone sizes, which, again, is not small and especially not compact. The original commenter was saying that 6.3"" was huge and no one was asking for phones that big, which is also, again, simply not true. Like, these things are verifiable and available to both of you at a moments notice, only a simple Google search away.
[deleted]
Sure you can define compact the way you view it. It's subjective anyway   

I'll center my view the way most media (MKB, MWTB, GSMArena, Androidauthority, Police) all refer to their review/guides/awards as compact phones around the 6.1"" size
You didn't tell me anything that I didn't now. Here is the price comparison between all smartphone socs.

Now tell me which is closer, Mediatek to Qualcomm or Mediatek to Exynos/Tensor?

>if they were true

They are the same prices mentioned in the article that you linked. 


>we would have chinese phone with those SoC

Hmm no? They are exclusive to Google and Samsung and not sold to anyone else. Just like how we don't have any other smartphone with and A series chip because it's exclusive to Apple.
[deleted]
You know they still have to pay to get the chips right? Google doesn't own its fab and Samsung has to sell both chips. It's just an estimate of the price that Samsung is asking for, just like the prices of Qualcomm and Mediatek are estimations based on TSMC's fab prices.

Android,"Immersive weather vibrations""","This cool feature in Pixel 9 pro simulates different weather conditions through vibrations, like drizzle, heavy rain, snow, and even thunderstorms. The best part? Each weather type has its own distinct vibration pattern! 🌨️⚡

Have you tried this yet?

Do any other phones have this feature ?

Comments:
I live in a desert and have yet to experience the vibrations
My 8 Pro has it enabled in settings but it doesn't work.
I have immersive vibrations on but I can't get it to do anything.
Mines on but no vibrations here. What am I missing?
It starts to vibrate when things get hot? 

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Does the 9 Pro support RichTap, it has some pretty cool vibration effects if your phone can support their API
Was confused on my pixel 8 when my phone started vibrating on a rainy day. Then I realized what's happening
I only have this on rain. No vibrations on any other conditions, like snow.
I usually looked out the window
I have no idea why you might want this. Is it not intensely annoying?
No, other phones actually have useful features like routines.
Behold the Tensor warmth
It only works for a certain weather, rain, storm, wind, snow. Sunny clear day doesn't do anything afaik
Same on my P8P.
Freezing rain will trigger the vibration on my phone - that goes away after tapping on the weather advisory and returning to the weather display.
It's pretty pleasant, if you played Astro bot on PS5 it's very similar, you can feel slight raindrops or wind while in the weather app depending on the weather
Someone who’s blind, who cannot see the radar would find this interesting. Also, if you’re deaf blind, this could be super helpful.
It's never worked when it's rained either. I've had a lot of rain in my area.
Astro Bot is such an amazing game. Everyone who owns a PS5 and hasn't at least played the bundled game is missing out and the full game is even better.
Are you in silent mode or DND? That's the only other reason I can think of
I don't think so. I still get vibrations for other notifications. Just not weather.",2024-12-08 05:55:15,35,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1h9c99f/immersive_weather_vibrations/

Looks extremely generic but interesting to see a new phone that isn't low-end with no camera bump
It's giving nexus 4 I like it
This machine is for testing, so I think it's true.
This is so ugly, going from the 8a to this cheap looking thing is wild
So strange they're doing away with the Pixel design language (ie: the camera bar), for.... what? Literally nothing.

I have nothing against phones with small cameras, in fact I think it's good, but they could have gotten away with a small bar and fit more internals, so idk why they didn't here.
Not too happy with the lack of a visor design language wise. Why? I've been waiting for the pixel 10 to upgrade but I'm a bit worried now.
Looks like a $50 USD phone that you find on AliExpress
This looks butt ugly
Tf wrong with camera positions 😭
I really really *really* hope they're not going to remove the camera bar in 3-4 years when I'll change my Pixel again. 

Not only it looks beautiful (or, it can), but it's also a convenient feature.

That saud, curious to see the EVT prototype dated May 2025. To me it means they ""a"" phones are developed almost in parallel to the main phones, just released much later.
Do not like.
Not a fan of the design. I wish they had gone the other way and compacted the 9 series. If this had been 5.8"", or even better, 5.5"", it would have been perfect.
No bump
It'd be a great phone if there wasn't other phones 10x more powerful for the same price
Designster (disaster)
eww a pixel 2 looks better than this
I love it, the camera bump sucks. It's such an obnoxious feature when phone manufacturers could have just made their phones thicker and use the extra space for slightly larger batteries.
but it does have a small bump? the edges of the camera are bumps.
I saw the 8a at Best Buy and thought it was a $25 Chinese TracFone.
Bet it'll still be phone of the year

Android,New Pixel 9 feature may use AI to auto-generate to-do lists from calls (APK Teardown),"

Comments:
Would be incredibly useful - I tested a call monitoring product earlier this year that recorded my calls to suggest/create calendar events and tasks. It was very useful and very accurate (only cancelled as the costs to call forward from Canada were too high).
Sounds like a privacy nightmare.
Wouldn't want this as an always on feature, but if there was a little toggle that would be useful for my business meetings.
I wish they used the almighty AI to make the AI/Assistant available in more languages.

I'm perfectly able to use it in English but I can't use it to send messages to my friends/family who do not speak it or use the awesome call features.
New feature will listen to your calls even if you disable it
Calls ? What is this thing?
pleasegodno.gif
Call notes work on-device with Gemini nano
I doubt it. It'll probably work on device like most of Google's other AI features.
Pretty much every Internet connected device is a privacy nightmare these days, IMO.
I havent used call notes but even if its enabled in the settings you have to actually activate it when you are in an active call
Yes but there are steps to get it under control. Having Google record and analyze your phone conversations is crazy.
No arguments there. Would be OK if we could  guarantee it was on device only but...",2024-12-05 15:35:33,83,13,https://www.androidauthority.com/google-phone-pixel-9-call-to-do-list-3505806/
Android,Google Pixel 9 Pro smartphone review - The compact flagship with great cameras,"

Comments:
Came from a 6a to the 9 Pro. I seriously *never* want a phone bigger than this. I really didn't want bigger than the 6a but the curved edges of the screen on the 9 make them very close comparatively 

Let the people with huge hands keep their 6.7"" screens. Way too big for me.
Doesnt seem to be much of a difference in perf, heat, throttling vs xl
Google certainly nailed it this year
Compact? 🤣
We need a phone like xz2 compact. Tired of using, big ass phones.
I just got my Pixel 9 Pro on a great Verizon deal a few weeks ago.  I enjoy the phone but it doesn't seem to be in the same flagship category when compared to some competitors...iPhone 16 Pro, One Plus 12, Samsung S24, etc.  While the Tensor is great for daily activities (I haven't experienced any performance issues), it seems way behind A18 and Snapdragon.  I was surprised to recently find that it is using older UFS 3.1 storage, while everyone else went to 4.0 a while ago.  Likewise, and I'm not sure if this affects Samsung and others, but it is now reported that a notable amount of the 16GB RAM is only accessible to Gemini/AI.  The only other issue I have is that the Wi-fi is still not good and switching to stronger APs in mesh set ups...I read this is not uncommon.  Inconvenience but not deal-breaker...and this seems to be an Android issue rather than a Pixel 9 Pro issue.

As for the camera, I guess it is great if you use 50MP setting and want big file sizes.  I have not been that impressed with 12MP setting...doesn't seem to be much better than older phones I've used.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  Even my wife's iPhone 16 appears to produce same quality...cameras seem to be getting hyped in the media.  Not bad, but not what I was expecting based on reviews.  I wish Google would enable a middle setting (e.g. 25MP) like Apple does.  

Lastly, more and more rumors are coming out about Samsung S25 series coming out.  Pixel 9 Pro looks like it may be even behind standard S25.

I don't game on my phone, which helps, and I do like vanilla Android over the other's skins...I do use Nova Launcher though, and I like that Google seems to release updates much faster than Samsung...not sure about One Plus.

the chip is too slow
""compact"" my ass, the phone is one of the biggest ones out there. if it was 5"", then it would be compact.
Pixel 6a: 152.2 x 71.8 x 8.9 mm 


Pixel 9 (Pro): 152.8 x 72 x 8.5 mm


They're barely different in size
Honestly Samsung does a good job helping me stay with pixel. Everytime I consider switching over for fun, I read user experiences on the camera, and I compare phone sizes on phone arena and I say ""oh yeah, that's why I haven't switched.""
At first I had to get used to the weight with the 9 pro. I come from huawei p30pro. Which is such a light phone. I was afraid my 9pro would slip out of my hand. Luckily with new case and all. 

WHAT A Freaking upgrade this is. 
I am very happy. The look feels like an old iphone SE I once had. But way much faster en smarter.
But what about the manual controls in camera app?
That's why I am awaiting delivery of the P8Pro. The 9 pro was too small for me. Feels like an old nokia in terms of size to me. Also, the P9ProXL costs way too much for what it is for me. There have been some great deals on the 9Pro here which put it only a couple hundred above a discounted P8Pro. Just wish the XL was getting similar discounts.
For the current standard? Yes
this is what compact looks like now you all need to get over it
Used to be phablet size.
I clicked the link to check exactly that, I thought there was a version id missed
""I have not been that impressed with 12MP setting...my wife's iPhone 16 appears to produce same quality"" 

Are you comparing 12MP photos from the Pixel 9 Pro against iphone 16 photos taken at 48MP or 25MP?
If you're a raging hardware supremacist who can't stand things you view inferior to exist. This is just a Google phone with the Googlest Android packed with hardware they chose to cook with. They targeting iphone users more than your Oppo or Vivo anyway. Like why let other oem make android phones if you want to steal their customer base
Except camera, screen and size; the three most important factors this sub looks for.
For what?
Pixel 6a weight: 178g

Pixel 9 pro weight: 199g

That extra 20g in the same body is a lot.
Agreed. I was looking into the S24+ but Samsung doesn't carry a comparable model with the new Pixels. 9 pro has better size, and you also don't get the higher resolution with Samsung's base model either. 

I would have also kept the 6a an extra year but all the talk about tariffs made me jump.
It's a really nice phone. I'm enjoying it. I'll hold onto this as long as is reasonable.
The 8 pro and 9 pro have manual controls but they are disabled on the base and A models. 
Seriously. There's a whole group of super vocal people on reddit who are furious that phones didn't stop getting bigger after the Galaxy S2. 

Small phones don't sell. Even Apple can't sell small phones. Almost no one wants to buy them. Let it go.
If the phone isn’t the same footprint as a Galaxy Ace they can keep it 😤😤😤
You don't get it. Lads using their phones with a single hand to avoid overexertion.
There will always be people complaining about the lack of compact flagships. Get over it.
You can't make me
I was comparing 12MP to 12 MP.  The iPhone 16 has options for 12MP, 24MP, and 48MP.  I haven't compared the Pixel at 50MP to the iPhone at 48MP.  My wife likes the 24MP setting...resolution and file size balance.
[deleted]
just look at phone benchmark and compare it to other flagship phones
I am using Pixel 4 (162 g) and wish it's a bit lighter. Every time I reach out for my old Nexus 5 (130 g) and Pixel (143 g) I miss how light they feel.


I wish phones go back to being light. It seems I'm the minority here, but I don't want to sacrifice the long term health of my hands for extra battery life that can be fixed by a power bank. I also do not associate heavy with premium feel, nor do I care about my tool feeling premium.
Adds to the premium feel of the phone. 9 Pro feels way different to hold and use.
Honestly, the combination of low weight and size is what has me pretty much fixated on the S25 by now, even though I really dislike the lack of UWB (and some other stuff missing compared to the larger and more expensive versions).

I have a OnePlus 8T (6.55"" so a bit larger than the 9 Pro, but lower weight at 188g) currently and I just don't want anything heavier, and certainly not bigger. But there are pretty much no alternatives, especially if you also don't want to use Xiaomi software.
Them absolutely nuking the 12 and 13 mini's battery 2200-2400 mah made it a very bad option. And Apple's slow charging didn't help
> Small phones don't sell. Even Apple can't sell small phones. Almost no one wants to buy them. Let it go.

I find this extremely surprising somehow.

>Small phones don't sell. Even Apple can't sell small phones.

Great, so then why call medium phones small phones? If people aren't making compact phones because people aren't buying compact phones, then call the bigger phone a bigger phone, not a compact one.
>Small phones don't sell. Even Apple can't sell small phones.

You do know that that ""not selling Apple small phone"" actually outsold most of Android models people are gushing over here, right?
So it's a toss up? Both are 12MP and the photos appear to be the same quality?

What you say seems to corroborate the comments of Pixel 8 users who say that the Pixel 9 is producing worse photos than the Pixel 8.
what? the software is what you’ll be noticing 99.9% of the time you’re using the phone. it can and absolutely does matter, i’d argue it’s by far the most important thing in any device, let alone the device you probably use the most.
What on earth are you talking about?

Literally everything I mentioned is better on Pixel.

[Display](https://www.dxomark.com/smartphones/#sort-display) is best in class.


[Camera](https://www.dxomark.com/smartphones/#sort-display) is also top of the leaderboard (except Huawei which I don't think counts because they're crippled outside China).

And the Oppo phone you referenced is larger.

It must be nice to live in an alternate reality.
> Literally everything you mentioned is better on Vivo and OPPO

I'd agree *if I cared this much about the spec sheet*. Problem is, both Vivo and Oppo phones have very limited cellular network compatibility this side of the Pacific Ocean, and guess what: **I need to make and receive calls**. WhatsApp voice chats aren't even an option. 

All I need to know really is I can do this with my current phone while visiting the US. With the Vivo/Oppo phones youre suggesting I use instead, the first error voice prompt I get is `no service`. Instant dealbreaker.
I understand its slower in bench marks. What difference does that make in real world performance?
Fire engine red Nexus 5 was 🐐
With you on this one. Premium to me is when my hand doesn't feel like it's holding stones after 10 minutes.
I bought a Pixel 6 and literally got tendonitis in my thumb from it. It was so heavy towards the camera bar that when holding it with one hand, I had to stretch my thumb so far down that after a month it was an actual problem. I sold it and bought a 6a once it came out and the soreness went away almost immediately. The 6 weighs 207g, and the 6a 178g, so 30g difference. If I throw a Pixel 3 in the mix, my personal favorite Pixel I've owned, that weighed 148g, with a glass back.
I'm sure, and I don't want that extra weight in a phone. If that weight was all functional, like battery or something, that would be one thing. But I know it's more glass that can break or something like that. Plastic backed phones are perfectly fine, thinner, lighter, and more durable.
Do you use it with a case? 


Going from a plastic back light phone and using it with no case, to a heavy glass back phone that I'm forced to put a case on, I'm a bit concerned with the weight. 
I don't know how they could put a larger battery in
Yeah, you have to put a smaller battery in a phone that's that small. Worse battery life is something almost every smaller phone had.
Why is that? There are almost none of them still around.
If they're the smallest phones around then they're small phones
Size is relative.    
People now consider 6.1-6.4 inch as small because it is relatively smaller.
Does it matter?
Compact and small are all relative terms. There's no standardized definition for them. There are no phones of the type you're talking about anymore, so small is bigger than it used to be.
And it still wasn't worth it to them. I don't get how you're disputing anything
Yeah, how is that supposed to be relevant? It still sold like shit compared to the entire rest of Apple's lineup and they discontinued it due to low sales. Not sure what's so hard to understand about this concept. Lol
Dxomark 🥱
Dxomark? Yea sure, such a reliable site.

Absolutely fuckin nothing unless you don't happen to have a PlayStation, a switch, a steam deck, a PC, or an Xbox to actually play video games.

Love this sub, and I get it's for ultra enthusiasts, but it's also exhausting. THE BeNChMaRkS what DO THEY SAY?!?!


The damn phone is fine. I have a pixel 8 and an iPhone. They're both fricken fine man. You wanna take really good photos? Get a fuckin pixel. Want benchmark specs and a phablet in your hand? Get a galaxy cause everybody knows they still can't get pictures right, even with gOdLy SuPrEmE sPeCs.  Cool, the genital measuring contest is done.
it depends on what you do on your phone
Yes. Weight hasn't been an issue for me either. And I'm not particularly fit either.
I have a budget Samsung A40 from 2 years before the 12/13, it's 1cm taller but the same weight 140g. That has a 3100mah battery
I don't know, but pretty much every woman in my office complains about the phone size when handing them their new work phones (currently Pixel 8a's) and a lot of them are still using the iPhone mini as a result ( I don't know the name).
I disagree, but even by that logic they're still not small phones
Those are small. You can't just compare diagonal screen sizes across different aspect ratios.

Modern 6"" phones are dramatically smaller in surface area, particularly width than a 6"" 16:9 screen.
So if ""small phones don't sell"", why is anyone scrambling to call these ""small phones""? Seems like they should gracefully avoid describing it in a way that makes it sound undesirable, no?
Because it didn't sell like shit and made billions of revenue? What part of how product sales work you fail to understand?
You probably don't know this, but vivo severely downgraded the main sensor in the x200 pro. 


It's about now about the same size as the main sensor in the Pixel 9. Since vivo doesn't use computational photography, it's impossible for it to output an image as good as a Pixel, which will break down multiple photos to stack and align. 


The X100 ultra had a 1"" sensor, which I would consider to be the absolute bare minimum of useable image quality without computational photography. With only a 1/1.2.8"" sensor the x200 pro will not output image quality that is anyway comparable to a 1"" sensor. 


Also, the x200 pro has a defect in its optical design that results in extreme flare in conditions you wouldn't expect it. Vivo has tried to correct this design defect with software, but it will degrade image quality even if it does work. 

>unless you don't happen to have a PlayStation, a switch, a steam deck, a PC, or an Xbox to actually play video games

Apparently people with a PC or console don't play games on their phones.     



>The damn phone is fine

In 2024? Yes! 4-5 years down the road? Will probably definitely age much worse.    

Pick up two phones of the same brand, one with 8 gen 1 and other with 8 plus gen 1, compare them side by side in 2025, I guarantee you'd see a slight noticeable difference


Do the same in 2026-27 it'll be much more
So you can't play games on phone if you own pc?
$1000+ phone with a midrange chip that overheats and struggles to play basic games... now imagine in 5 years...
> it depends on what you do on your phone

>>>>> the chip is too slow

Way to contradict youreself in the same conversation chain, so you do you.
Agreed with that too
Okay let me put it this way.    
If a company decides to call a 2 inch phone a ""small phone"" and it doesn't sell well obviously      
Will you stop calling a 5 inch phone ""small""?     

No. Its still small.      

People want smaller phones relatively but evidently sub 6 inch phones aren't that good for modern usecase.      


To put it simply in one line- ""Public wants a phone that is both pleasant to consume on and small""
What are you even arguing for?
It clearly didn't make enough since Apple doesn't sell them anymore
Most people change their phone after 5 years, hell, even 3. Who cares.
The biggest issue in this subreddit is people who only speak in hyperbole and lack nuance. 

I've owned a pixel since the first one. Here and there it warms up, when I'm navigating thru Spotify, while going thru videos deleting them, and running maps at the same time and it's 84f in the car. *Oh well.* Honestly, I've had my galaxies and my iPhones warm up too. Can anybody say **DEAL BREAKERRRRRRRRR**

Gaming I don't know much about. Again, unless it's a game built for android like some angry birds or pocket plains, I'm not bothering. I have my consoles for that. Marking demerit points in the pixel because it can't play an intensive game very well is peak android subreddit. That's such an incredibly minute niche issue, it isn't even funny. 

But yes, I paid 700 for my pixel 8 and it is the only android phone that can take consistently good photos and comes with good software. I think not running crisis core on a phone is much more excusable than not taking a photo of a dog chasing a ball. After all, Galaxy's are 1200 bucks and it can't reliably take a photo? *Psh*
there is no contradiction here. The chip is slow by many objective measures.

>If a company decides to call a 2 inch phone a ""small phone"" and it doesn't sell well obviously      
Will you stop calling a 5 inch phone ""small""?     

Yes, of course. Did you think that was going to be a hard question? 


>People want smaller phones relatively but evidently sub 6 inch phones aren't that good for modern usecase.      

Agreed, people want medium and large phones. If a small phone is too small, then they want a not-small phone. I am not sure why you're insisting that we must call medium phones small phones.
Using adjectives appropriately. How about you?
Its been less than 3 years since 8g1 launched and differences are evident.      

People use phones for longer if they age gracefully, there are plenty of people I know still on iPhone 11 and 12.    
I'm sure 8g2 flagships will see many more long term users compared to 8g1.     


>Most people change their phone after 5 years, hell, even 3.

So are you also claiming updates after 5 years are worthless too?
It's not worth arguing with them.


I just switched from a Tensor G1, which this sub must think is unusable, to a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Does it matter for my use case? Absolutely not.
> The chip is slow by many objective measures

...according to a *Honkai Star Rail* and *Genshin Impact* super regular.

Lol.
Can you please tell me on what basis are you calling a phone a medium or a small phone?   


Is 4 inch small? Or 2? Or 6? Where exactly does medium start?



There exists 2 inch phone somewhere in the world, we used to have 3 inch touchscreens back in early 2010s, that means we can never call any phone over 4 inch small
""Small"" is subjective. 

Shaq would call it small, Peter Dinklage would need to use both hands.
I'm not sure why you're struggling so hard to wrap your head around this. Lol

Do you go around getting mad at people for saying ""car"" because technically car is short for carriage and modern cars are ""motorized carriages""  and people should ""use words correctly?""

No, because judging something by a standard that hasn't existed in forever is stupid.
Average redditor argues about nothing and wastes his time, not surprising.
Yes. Frame rates in video games are objectively measurable, and a slow chip would produce less frames. Very shocking to see creepy people looking at my browsing history when I am just pointing out a objective downside of the flagship phone.
I think that's a transparently silly argument to try to make. 

But even if I were to take you seriously, that is more support for what I am saying.
And is wrong at the same time.
> Frame rates in video games are objectively measurable

I don't play gacha games. Youre argument falls flat on its face.

> Very shocking to see creepy people looking at my browsing history

Youre user history is public viewable. Feel free to delete youre user account if you don't like it.
Let those people be they will never concede the point, google charging flagship price for subpar chipset is for these kind of  people to fall for, they don't understand it affects the longevity and performance if you keep your phone for years

I'm not the target audience for this. But hey this is cool still.
Slowly but surely I see more Pixel's in the wild and read more and more about Google pushing on advertising. 

Business is booming.
Pretty lazy collab. I have a previous model Instax printer and it is the same shade of pink.
A hundred times this.
Oh yes. I want it so much that my next phone will be one from the Chinese top brands. I really like how they handle photography.
10000000%
Omg yes!
You can do so by using the VSCO app
Yeah I also think we notice it more often due to its design being recognizable as well.
I was shocked on a recent trip in Australia seeing how many of the phones people were fishing out of their pockets immediately upon landing were Pixels. Similarly in Japan, where their ads and sponsorships are omnipresent.
I just got the Pixel 9 Pro a couple of weeks ago and I'm loving it! I finally moved away from Samsung after staying loyal for 14 years!
I wish them well but most of the Pixel advertising is just bad. I think they could do even better with some better advertising.

Android,The best foldable photo smartphone? Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review,"

Comments:
**Pros:**

+premium case

+bright OLED screens

+good battery life

+nice speakers

+long updates

**Cons:**

-low PWM flickering

-thick bezels

-a relatively weak SoC

-throttling
Sat next to a chap on a flight last week using one of these to watch a movie with the screen unfolded....

...in 4:3 crop :-/
I returned my fold pro for a pro 9 xl. It's a good phone but I think they need to let it cook a bit longer. I may try again with the 10 or 11.
Only $1500 on sale.
2 months into ownership and I gotta say it's been a while since I owned a phone that didn't feel like a 'slightly faster screen brick'. I think everyone who focuses on 'spec sheets' misses the Forrest for the trees. Everytime I use it or flip it open I'm impressed and it's so DAMN thin it feels like It's from star trek or something. Nothing ever feels slow or unresponsive, maybe I just got one with a binned chip?
I can't wait to see the next iteration of this bad boy with a $60 SoC.
Just saw the pixel 9 fold in the store a few days ago. It was nice. I just can't get over the fact you can damage the inside display with your fingernail. And yes I know this is for every foldable out there.
when i put it on magsafe holder  , the front screen turns off and it goes to inner screen, even it is folded .can anyone else try it ? it is very bad and disappointing  !!
$2,099 on sale here in Canada
Those cons (save bezels, I genuinely dgaf but I'm plenty sure it's a major point of contention for others) are significant relative to the pros.
How is nothing related to the cameras in the Pros column when it was important enough to differentiate the Pixel fold as the ""best foldable **photo** smartphone""?
So many out there would rather watch a cropped vid than have minor black bars. 
What was the movie?
Still waiting for the foldable with a 21:9 screen for us consumers
I swapped my OG Pixel Fold for a Pro 9 XL. I just didn't use the folding part enough to justify having it and the compromises in other ways wasn't worth it.
The Tensor G4's performance in the 9 Pro Fold is definitely a bit annoying given it's £1449 for 256 GB storage/£1569 for 512 GB storage off Google's website in the UK before trade ins/discounts.
No pro or con is big enough compared to constant headaches due to flickering.
Bezels would be more of a deal breaker if the other cons weren't more significant. It'd be hard for me to deal with them again after years of thin/no bezels. Esp knowing they'd likely be thinned out in the next iteration.
If you take a look at Honor Magic V3, and compare it to pixel and Z fold it is night and day. The bezel on left side of pixel and Z looks like a brick from 1700s compared to Magic V3. So yes, those bezels do matter. It is fucking hideous.
The biggest reason I didnt buy one is because I cant stand having less features then the 9 pro and paying more
Don't know man I can't remember the last time I felt bottlenecked by a chip. Even a midrange chip from 3 years ago is incredibly Snappy for most things you can do on the phone. The 865/855/ I can't think of a single game on the Play Store that those can't run.

And they can edit 4K video and render it reasonably fast.

It's not like a PC where you have endless frame rates you can push tons of AAA titles and graphically intense software projects.

I think the bigger concern is battery but most testing shows that this generation of pixels has been pretty good with battery although probably because of the heavy throttling.

Nothing new though I mean Samsung got rid of performance mode on their folds. I mean it's literally throttled by default and can't be unthrottled and that's without even getting into the GOS throttling Scandal which caused the fold three I believe to be delisted from geekbench along with five generations of their other phones and tablets
Tbh, can't remember, but it got me thinking about just how little media would be able to actually use that form factor in full screen.
Wouldn't the phone have to be really wide(the front screen)?
I found myself closing it all the time for the most basic reasons like typing.
Yeah I just read the article and sheesh those performance numbers are ***rough!*** 

A few more years in the oven yet for foldables for me personally, but I appreciate the improvements still being made - however slowly.
But what specifically can't you do on it that you could do on like an 8th Gen 3? It can run all the GTA ports/ genshin in fact that was doable on the 855.

I don't know I don't emulate so maybe there's a bottleneck there I don't know. I mean I've seen plenty of videos on YouTube but people are emulating on pixels older than this but I can't speak in first person so if that's a weakness and you like emulation then sure.

To be clear I don't mean engaging apologetics for Pixel. I'm using a OnePlus 12.

 I think their decision to use the Samsung Foundry was a terrible one and I'm glad they've changed up and they're switching to tsmc for the next gen.

And frankly I think they're price increases the last two years have been pretty lame specially with no corresponding storage bump. I think the pixel 9 pricing was an incredible bummer and don't really understand why anyone would buy one over a pixel 8 Pro which you can get for 50 cents on the dollar brand new or even a pixel 7 Pro which you can get for 33 cents on the dollar brand new

Do sometimes feel like people overestimate how important a bleeding edge chipset is on a smartphone though. People have a hard time explaining to me what the bottleneck is
One complaint I don't hear often is that small bezels are annoying without a case because the edge of the screen detects your palm which is holding the phone when you're reaching across to tap with your finger. Does that happen on modern small bezel phones? (I have a Galaxy S10)
If you're into retro gaming and emulation, that screen is amazing.
[removed]
I actually just don't get this...am I just not using my phone in the same way as other people but my Pixel phones have literally never been slow. I can open up an old Pixel 3 and it's still instant at loading apps and web pages. Why do people care about the speed of the soc now? What are they doing on their phones?
Okay but is there anything you can't do on the pixel that you can do on like a Snapdragon powered. What are the actual consequences of the week performance numbers besides the benchmarks? Are there any games that it can't run at 60fps? I mean I guess maybe there would be more frame rate drops if you're really into gension specifically but most games on Android are incredibly easy to run on 855 or even like a 720 G from 5 years ago. 

Despite their poor performance it renders video faster than Snapdragon so that's not a bottleneck. Don't even getting into the fact that maybe 1% of users are actually rendering videos on their phone.

There's no argument about the Silicon is incredibly flawed and I'm glad they're ditching Samsung's Foundry but will someone please tell me what the actual literal downside is in the short term?

I to see some consequences for it in the long term because Samsung's Foundry can't compete which will keep qualcomm's prices in tsmcs prices incredibly expensive.

Eventually if phones can start pushing AAA games this long-term lull in development for exynos and Samsung Foundry chips could become a problem but by then you won't still own this phone.

And by then the new pixels won't even be using Samsung silicon so just don't really understand why people are so obsessed about this.

I know I must come off as some pixel fan girl here. I'm not I don't even recommend the pixel 9 I would encourage someone to either buy a pixel 8 pro or 1 + 12 or maybe an s23 ultra or something on the resale Market. ( I don't use foldables and don't really want to)  

Just bugs me how people act like this is a PC where performance actually has a strong correlation with the output of your machine. The bottleneck is the OS in the lack of games on the OS.

The only thing I can think of is emulation? Maybe? I mean they sell purpose made emulation machines with 730gs and 845s and so on but I'm sure there's some emulators that are power intensive that might drop frame rates on a pixel.

But for non emulators I don't really know what the downside is in the short term
Still though you've got to think of the aspect ratio of the phone. When you fold a screen in half all the space has to be somewhere 
That's hilarious that you think the Pixel 3 is still snappy when it wasn't considered snappy at release with only 4GB of RAM. Multi-tasking was a huge ask of the phone upon release with it constantly dumping apps because of the lack of RAM, which in 2024 would be exacerbated by its now horribly old SOC as it has to constantly reload apps as you switch to them.
People like battery life.  People don't like stuttering constantly.  If you haven't noticed it, you either have the one Pixel on the planet that doesn't do it, or you aren't paying attention or taking note when it happens.  Also, if a device is supposed to last 7 years, it BARELY being smooth/functional at launch is a huge red flag.
You might have your fanboy glasses on
I don't get the obsession over synthetic numbers that rarely reflect real use cases either
Either they are watching 4k Midget porn or watching 4k Midget porn. It is one or both. 

I had the original pixel fold and it did all I wanted it to do.  I just traded it in and got the Pixel 9 pro XL.  

My original pixel did all I wanted it to do so I am not sure how people make issues about the SOC. Yes, it can get a bit warm but it is once in a while. My current P9P XL works and I don't have any concerns at this point.
Same for me had the 8pro and now the 9xl. Although 9xl battery life is better, 8p wasn't bad. The 9 has been amazing and gets me through the day easy. I have a s24+ and Xiaomi 13 pro and I prefer the pixel to all the others. Been smooth, no issues, doesn't get hot (Samsung does), battery life is good enough for me and prefer the pixel UI even though you can customize more on one UI, I hate the Chinese software stuff. Basically knock off iOS it feels like. 

So ya, tensor is amazing for me and for most people. I think the ones who report bad battery life with pixels are  heavy users and people who play games on their phone. I have zero interest in gaming on my phone. That's what my ps5 is for. Most I'll do is play some dominos while sitting at the airport or something. 

Used to be a Samsung fan but they are starting to go down the apple road of little to no innovation so it's pixel for me now. But again, everyone has different needs I want a pixel fold because it will suit me because I don't play games, don't want the pen, and even using Samsung for over a decade I never used dex but just because I don't use my phone for those things doesn't mean others don't. All personal preference
I find some apps are just poorly optimized and you need a good phone to brute force it. Pikmin Bloom, Cronometer, and Chrome being 3 that I use.
I mean, maybe? But I use it all the time for testing stuff for a client of mine and it opens Chrome instantly, WhatsApp instantly, camera very quickly. Does the average person actually notice this stuff?
Yeah my 9 Pro XLs battery life was hysterically awful. Barely got me through the work day brand new.
Wasn't Pixel touted as byttery smooth or whatever?
The synthetic numbers point out that the phone is slower than the competition.

This is seen in real use and will be felt even further was the phone ages and apps come out that demand more power.
Can't speak for the ""average person."" The ""average"" person in the US isn't using an Android.
Prove it
Yea, every Pixel that has the Tensor has terrible battery life.  Its been getting better a little bit each generation, but its about to be exposed for how awful it is in the US as soon as the OnePlus 13 launches with the new Snapdragon 8 Elite and new silicon carbide 6000mah battery.  The OP13 is going to have nearly DOUBLE the battery life of the P9PXL in the same size device.
Smooth and fast are not the same. Smoothing out app opening/closing animations does not make a fast phone.

Longer waiting for splash screens compared to the competition is typical and having to put up with longer wait times to render content on the screen in apps if you flick up/down quickly is also typical.

There are also open issues for general jank with tensor Pixels.

Only very early Pixels. Others have caught up on that.
It's smooth if you remain in like the Pixel launcher.  As soon as you launch an app, control leaves Google's hands and its all on how well the shitty Tensor can handle potentially poorly written mobile app code.  And its shown again and again, he can't even smoothly handle poorly written mobile app code that comes directly from Google without stuttering.
I have a used Galaxy S10 with pretty crummy battery life but I've tried multiple new batteries. Still bad. I suspected that it could be defective and causing higher battery usage, but I have no idea as I didn't own this phone new. To hear that newer in design and age phones have bad battery life is interesting! 

I remember my galaxy s6 active having much longer life, even though it was fast for its time, but it has a larger battery than the S10. My previous 2 phones were slow but had great battery life. The S10 seems to speedily lose battery even doing nothing like watching a video, and doing web browsing seriously tanks the battery
That's embarrassing if it couldn't do it properly, assuming other flagships could do it.
I've never had luck with replacing batteries in a phone unless I went out of my way to replace it with a known OEM battery.  Its possible you've been replacing the OEM battery with Chinese replacements which are lower capacity, I've certainly done that a few times.",2024-11-24 12:32:53,143,52,https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-best-foldable-photo-smartphone-Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-review.922485.0.html
Android,Review: Google's Pixel 9 display is as good as it gets,"

Comments:
It is a great display. Now just wish Google would fix their overly aggressive dimming. Lying on my couch doom scrolling and it will dim dramatically if I tip it even close to 90 degrees.
Except for pretty low hertz PWM dimming
Thanks for the share! Sadly, I only have the base 9 this time around to review, so no Pro coverage. But feel free to ask me any questions about the 9
Dylan Raga is back!
It's as good as it gets until you find out there are two panel vendors. The best OLED panel is obviously from Samsung, so you might get either a Samsung panel or one from BOE.

The panel lottery is terrible, just like when you used to buy a 3DS and could end up with either a terrible-looking TN panel or a good-looking IPS panel.
Just me, or do the whites appear more grey on pixel 9? I feel like my S24U (especially with anti-glare coating) has a more vibrant and color accurate display than my Pixel 9 Pro. Both are great don't get me wrong, but s24U takes the top IMO.
Pixel displays have been top of the line since the 8 series. Dxomark has them as the best displays. Pretty impressive jump coming from the 7 series.
Until next phone tat gets released
The single good component they use in their phones.  Every other component is chosen for maximum profit margin.
Overheating all day long
Agreed. I think this is the first phone where that's actually bothered me. God forbid you hold the phone sideways. Feels like it immediately dims every time.
Coming from a Samsung Fold 4, the auto dimming on my Pixel 9 is soo shit. I don't think I've had to manually adjust my brightness this often since my Galaxy S3...
It also annoys me a lot when I turn up the brightness to see something, and the second I return to my content the phone is like ""oh it seems you turned up your brightness by mistake, here let me dim it twice as much for you""
Maybe it's doing you a favor with the doom scrolling
Ditto. 

What happened to the whole learning thing?

Why must you dim the absolute crap out of my screen when I have told you numerous times that I want it brighter?
don't doom scroll
[deleted]
Why would they do that?
Great review as always! My question is does the 9 pro only source it's panel from SDC? My 9 pro's panel is displayed as panel-google-cm4, do you have any insights into it's manufacturer?

Thanks!
Other than the display, is it a phone worth buying? I feel like the rest of the hardware is lacking behind other flagships, and they're desperately trying to hold everything together with software.
Sorry I'm a bit late to the party here, but I only just got a Pixel 8.

I've noticed *really* bad green shift at low brightness, especially when displaying greys, but still with other colours too. The whole display looks really washed out at night, almost like I have a filter on it, which I guess reduces black crush but comes at the cost of colours and contrast. A good example is [shown](https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/google_pixel8_nbd_60hz.png) in [your Pixel 8 display review](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-8-display-deep-dive/). I'm guessing Google tried to lift near-blacks at low brightness but only the green subpixel was capable of lifting properly or something, but I'm no display engineer.

Just wondering if this is still the case on the Pixel 9?
Please tell about heating, battery life time, UI bugs, scratch resistance, wifi connection quality.
Is that the guy who used to review displays at XDA a couple of years ago?
Finally he's dropped an article for it, I remember him saying ""Soon"" when asked about it😂
Why is the best ""obviously"" from Samsung? Samsung has had a lot of problems over the years, still fucking does. BOE makes great panels too. Now, if there is a problem in manufacturing and Quality Control, that's another issue.
Could you compare the battery life on your s24u and pixel 9?
I would hope a phone that is almost $700 more look and feel even better.
I haven't felt if heat up even once yet. What are you doing with yours 😂
^ overheated comment
I think it is because since the pixel 6, they use two light sensors. The front and on the back for detecting light.

When you block it with your hand on the back, it thinks you have whatever light it sees looking back at you but it sees darkness in the direction the back of the phone is facing, which would be what your own eyes are likely to see. 

If the phone dies because I move (and as long as I am not blocking a sensor), I keep the phone where I moved it to, adjust the slider, and that adds the front and back light levels detected to the AI model for the auto brightness. After a few weeks of ownership, I almost never have to touch it (some edge cases may still show up but as long as you tell it what to do in those cases, then you don't have to adjust in the future)
Wait, you guys let your phone do all the thinking for adjusting brightness? I don't think that feature has ever worked nicely.
Or Google could make their auto-dimming work properly.....
No thanks, I returned my Pixel instead. Why disable a useful feature when it works great on every other brand.

I live in Australia too so good brightness is important.
Yes, it does appear that the 9 Pro only has an SDC variant and a single display driver.
I don’t think there’s any one thing I can point to that could persuade someone to buy the Pixel 9 — it’s a pretty boring phone that looks great and feels great with one of the most polished Android experiences. However, it also doesn’t really do anything remarkably bad, at least as far as I can tell, and it’s kind of a first for the Pixels. It’s at least above average in all the things that matter, which is a win in my book. At MSRP it’s still a bit of a hard sell, and I’d personally shell out extra for the Pro, mainly because I find a telephone lens to be an invaluable everyday tool (the Pixel 4 got it right). If you can get it at a decent discount, I don’t think you could go wrong with it and it should serve you well.
On the unit I tested, at 60 Hz the display natively still targeted gamma 2.2 (ever so slightly lighter) even at minimum brightness, whereas past Pixels seemed to intentionally lift at minimum. The 120 Hz calibration though was moderately lifted, not much of a tint, but enough to introduce a mild flicker when the screen switched refresh rates in low light. LTPO seems overdue, hopefully the base model gets it next year.
As a 2 month user now, I have no issues with heating even with my case and screen protector adding to the issue. Battery life isn't as good as I had hoped for 4700 mah, I'm getting about 6:30 SoT with YouTube/texting/doom scrolling. No issues with UI bugs so far, android 15 has been nice to me.
Scratch resistance is the same as any regular gorilla glass, small scratches at mohs 6, deeper scratches at mohs 7.
Wi-Fi connection quality is stupid good, I have wifi 30 feet from my house sometimes, to the point I wonder why my data is being slow 🤣
Yup. His last phone display review for XDA was for the Pixel 8.
Anyone browsing r/SteamDeck knows how badly Samsung is being panned for mura issues as compared to BOE lmao.
Yeah it worked totally fine on my previous two phones. After the first couple of weeks, I rarely had to adjust my brightness manually on my Fold 4.
I've never had a decent auto brightness on any phone, not any Pixel, nor any iPhone, Samsung, HTC, etc. I don't even understand why this feature exists at all. Just turn it off.
Not a question, but it's wild to look back at it and see the Pixel 7 pro pulling 6.4w for 960nits while the basic Pixel 9 only needs 2w for 1000 nits and 4.9w for the peak 1750 nits.
I'm still kicking myself for not pulling the trigger on getting the 9 on Amazon a couple days ago for $549.. That feels like what the phone should be worth but then the price shot right back up. It was even that price on BestBuy as well for just that day.
Thank you! Agreed about LTPO for the Pixel 10.

I look forward to your reviews every year, because no other reviewer actually goes into this type of depth when it comes to displays. Your work and eye for detail is very much appreciated 🙂
Excellent, very nice to see him doing smartphone display reviews again!
Samsung has adaptive brightness and after some slight tweaks it's perfect.
Dereshishishishishi
My s22 auto dims to basically zero at 5 percent battery with no way to turn it off that ive found anywhere. Its rather irritating particualrly as it does it as im reading the screen usually, on a bright sunny day its brutal
[deleted]
Damn you’ve had bad luck then. Auto brightness is one of the best features when done right.
Always appreciate the support! 🙏🏽
I just realised I barely ever touch the brightness slider now.
Man how often are you at 5% battery lol
It has been shit for years on Pixels you mean. The last one that didn't do this was the 4 I think. Although I didn't try the 5.
Samsung nailed it with the adaptive brightness. I have used other phones and they don't get it quite right.

It learns what you prefer for brightness in certain lightning.
My brightness has always been at a good level, I've manually adjusted it for watching videos move vividly sometimes through swipe controls but my auto brightness actually works pretty damn well ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯
often. i dont spend all day in the house. i have a family. but you missed the point. the point is when it does that, that there is no shut off.
or did you miss the point to be a troll.
It does get slightly better with time, but it still has more issues than not. Mainly it goes too dim most of the time, I wish there was a threshold we could set because sometimes it makes the screen unreadable. Going bright is fine, that's the easy one though, it never seems to actually learn your darkness preferences I'm always having to slightly alter it to the same spot each time. Doesn't seem very learning to me
That's good to hear. My previous phone was a OnePlus 7 Pro, which I had to up the brightness on quite often, so it made me happy reading the comments above and realising that's an issue I don't have anymore 🙂
also. some phones can last a surprising amt of time at that amount.
They decimated the brightness on my 7T with android 11. It was perfect with OOS 10. 

For funsies I installed OOS 12 and it's just a shell of its former OOS 11. Can't believe people were defending that crappy update.",2024-11-13 23:21:02,211,60,https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-9-display-review/

I hard disagree with the Vivo. The sensor is super impressive, but the software processing is super sub-par and inconsistent. Super overrated phone.

The pixel 9 pro still captures better, more consistently high quality photos and videos, as does the iPhone 16 pro/max and S25U.

I want to buy a phone with a good battery and nice camera. I always have used samsung galaxy phones since Galaxy S2, but the latest galaxy still used old cameras from galaxy S22 so I'm thinking about Pixel 9 pro. Is there anything else good in pixel 9 pro than better cameras? I can get new galaxy s25+ for about 800 € and used pixel 9 pro is about 700€ (new 1200€, not any good discount atm)

If geekbench scores are anything to go by the S25+ is far better performance wise
>Is there anything else good in the Pixel 9 pro besides better cameras?

5x optical zoom. Imo no. The much more versatile and powerful S25+. Even AI is integrated into the S25 series.
The Pixel is more durable due to the possibility of installing GraphenOS upon use or after support if the hardware does not degrade.
The most annoying thing about pixel 9 pro is that you can't use the telephoto camera for portraits... Like why",2025-02-07 15:38:21,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1ijxsjk/pixel_9_pro_or_galaxy_s25/

OnePlus 13.

You already have an excellent device. It has outperformed almost every other phone in the market, leaving aside charging speeds. Switching to any other device for aesthetics may disappoint you as other devices may not provide the curated experience that Samsung has concocted with the S24U. Do not go for a Chinese manufacturer, you will find refinement and bug issues across the device. Switching over to iOS will lock you into Apple's way of working, also the lack of all Android customizations and freedom. Don't forget the iOS 18 update issues iPhones are facing. Apple is now selling something which is not even ready yet (Apple Intelligence) unless you want to pay premium to get it. If you still want a new device, then you can go for OnePlus 13. It has everything under the belt to keep you interested. It won't disappoint you!
Honor Magic 7 Pro is an amazing phone and no - it's software package won't frustrate you. It is very stabile and even includes a desktop replacement feature like Samsung's DeX. 


Of the 3 you mention, both Pixel and iPhone have a not-a-day battery and slow charging. Honor's battery is a two-day variety... 


By the time honor's review is out, it may be proclaimed ""the best camera smartphone"" in the world, like Magic 6 Pro was... 
>I want to change it because it is too square.

This is literally the biggest design change of the S25 ultra.

In the Honor magic 7 pro list

Otherwise Oneplus 13 or 13r depending on the budget
I switched from Samsung to ip16 PRO Max. Still have my new oneplus nord 4 as backup. Love oxygenOS more then OneUI. The iPhone tho. Its just the feeling. It makes Android systems and stuff feel so plastic. Cheap.
Keep your S24u.  Maybe try the P9P but the others are, IMHO huge downgrades.

I think you are looking for a smaller phone like a startac on 2g.
thank you for your opinion :D
OnePlus is still from a chinese manufacturer.
iPhone 16 PRO Max has 2 days of battery bro what do you mean. I finish a long dat with 50% lett of moderate use. iOS is unbeatable. Apps works so much better. And if you like watching media without headphones? Oh boy the speakers are so freakin good. The optimized feel you cant find anywhere else.
the idea is that i don't use  ai that much and on buy back i get only  500 eur, even though i paid 1200 eur, it's frustrating
16PM is not what I said, my brother. We are taking about 16P...  Yes, you are right. The bigger one has a proper 2 day battery... 
Yes too bad it's only an upgrade for the S25 or IA.

Smartphones,Recieved my 16 pro max and Google Pixel 9 pro.. hard to pick.,"Recieved both. It's hard to decide which to actually keep.

The 16 pro max is 500 euro more than the pixel both feel really nice in the hand.. (well more like 400 but I'm waiting for the 80 eur discount after purchase to be sent)

I've been enjoying both, I believe the 16pm battery seems to last a good bit longer in comparison to the pixel and the amount of preset filters etc feels really nice and the better chip making the phone better in the long term? The 16pm has 256gb storage while the p9pxl has 128gb since it was the only one around this price, both are fine since 128gb+google drive is okay. Even though the pixel has a weaker chip it still feels extremely snappy and I've not ran into any overheating issues people talked about even gaming in cod mobile or NFS had no issues or it wasnt laggy.

Build quality they both feel really nice in the hand. I know the pixel is aluminium and the iPhone is titanium.

Software wise at first I wasnt liking iOS, I thought it was weird icons looked weird but after using it I do not mind it as much as I thought I would. I heard there will be iOS19 or something that should make promising updates in the future but very unsure. Pixel.. android is android I'm coming from a pixel 7 pro, mainly upgrading over the screen the new screens on these 2 phones are so much better and battery effiency.

Camera wise I believe they're very similar but different, The selfie camera on the iPhone seems way better and it captures details up close like if I was to take a picture of my eye on the iphone it'd be ultra clear while the pixel would be very blurry. The pixel tends to take photos with more accurate colors and it picks up more details like even a glass panel with dirt on it is censored out by the iPhone for no reason? It also seems the iPhone over sharpens certain details to make it more HD. While other times the Pixel adds random white glows around example a pigeon, here for example: [https://imgur.com/a/iphone-16-pro-max-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-G7oPCc7](https://imgur.com/a/iphone-16-pro-max-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-G7oPCc7)

It's really hard to pick both phones are amazing. They both feel and look great, the pictures are nice on both but have a very different aesthetic some settings like exposure missing on the pixel is one but not a big thing. OS wise neither is a deal breaker to me, Maybe notifcations on iOS are a little annoying or different but it's a different OS soo..

I was contemplating the S25 ultra also as a middle ground since thats what people say but I've heard theyre using an older M13+ screen and it's somewhat darker and the whites are more blue-ish than the 16pm and p9pxl and using a screen protector removes the anti reflection? It's possible to get s25 ultra + galaxy 7 watch for 980, but I heard lots of bad things about one ui and galaxy phones getting green lines down the screen so on.

  
From your experience if you had hands on also with these phones which did you keep? and why?

Do you care about having the ability to install any app you want through APKs? Only android allows that and it's the largest selling point for a lot of people.
I switched from a Galaxy S24 Ultra, I mean Don't get me wrong it's an amazing beast and does more than enough but Apple Just Does Everything So Much better than What Samsung Does . Samsung used to be an innovating Company but now its just a apple clone and nothing more so for me there's no going back to samsung.

I dont really care about APKs no
Yea from one ui 7 it seems theyre trying to copy everything apple does but make it more customizable but it wont work since android is generally more buggy?
it is more laggy and less app optimisation but you know Android is still amazing to use and of course you have far more freedom but i don't know i just love the feel of the apple products there are so premium feeling devices and alao the best ecosystem",2025-02-05 21:34:16,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1iiljxr/recieved_my_16_pro_max_and_google_pixel_9_pro/
Smartphones,Should I Upgrade to the Vivo X200 Pro Now or Wait for Future Releases? (Camera Dilemma),"Hey everyone! I’m currently using a OnePlus 12 and have been pretty happy with it, but I’ve been eyeing the Vivo X200 Pro lately. From my personal testing, the camera quality (especially in low light and portrait mode) seems roughly 30% better to my eyes. The dynamic range and detail are noticeably sharper, which is tempting as a photography enthusiast.  

The catch: I can afford to switch right now, but I’m torn. With new flagships like the Pixel 9 series, iPhone 16 lineup, and next-gen Vivo/OPPO devices rumored to drop in the next 6-8 months, I’m wondering:  

1. Is the Vivo X200 Pro’s camera leap worth upgrading immediately, or should I hold out for potentially bigger improvements later?  
2. Anyone here made the jump from OnePlus to Vivo? How’s the long-term experience?  
3. Are there any leaks/rumors about significant camera upgrades in late 2024/early 2025 phones that might overshadow the X200 Pro?  

I know tech always gets better, but that 30% difference is gnawing at me. Would love your thoughts—am I overthinking this, or is patience the play?

Smartphones,Samsung Galaxy S24/25 or iPhone 16 Plus,"I have posted before but I am now torn between 2 phones for my next upgrade. I currently own the Honor Magic 6 Lite which I don't dislike at all, but there are some connectivity issues and issues with the camera. 

I have ruled out the Pixel 9 after reading so many bad things about it I am not willing to take the risk. I am reconsidering Samsung as an option. 

I have owned 3 iPhones the iPhone 4 which I had for just over a year before Apple released an update which broke the phone and it couldn't be fixed. The iPhone 8 was the best phone I have ever owned and lasted 6 years before I needed to replace it and the iPhone 12 was a terrible phone riddled with issues. 

I have owned 4 Samsungs over the last 10 years 2 from the S range and 2 from the A range. All of them had issues with longevity, battery degradation, software issues, connectivity issues, lag, freezing alot and they all needed replacing within the 2 year time frame. I use my phone for the most basic of tasks. It has put me off Samsung, yet I know many people who have had Samsung phones for years and they are still going strong. Maybe I have been unlucky. 

I do want a flagship phone but after spending all of that money I want to get 4-6 years out of it, if not more. In terms of software I do not have a preference. I like both Android and iOS equally and the lack of customisation on iOS doesn't bother me. 

I own a mix of devices:-
iPad & Samsung tablet (iPad is 7/8 years old and still works). 
iPod and Airpods
Macbook. 
Honor Buds. 
Huawei WatchFit3. 

I have read about issues with both the phones I'm torn between. I am wondering what people would pick between the 2 and why? 

Please don't mention other brands & models. I have narrowed it down to these 2 after reading so many good things about Samsung compared to Pixel Samsung is now an option I am considering again. 

Comments:
I am both an Android and iphone user and I just got the S25. I wanted a smaller form factor and IMO, the Samsung is snappier than the iphone . I like both but prefer the freedom that the S25 gives me. I can do more on it than on my iphone . Each serves it purpose but if I had to pick one than I'd definitely go with the S25.
Since you're indifferent to OS, just get the size that works best for you. S25 is smaller, lighter and more pocket-friendly, but if you prefer a bigger screen the ip16+ is best. The latter probably also has better battery life, but it's capped to 60hz and has 1 less telephoto lens. 

I'd rule out the s24 especially if you live in an exynos region, but even so the sd8 elite is reported to so much better than the 8gen3 it doesn't make sense to get s24 to save a few bucks when you're intending to hold it for 6 years.


Iphone 16+: bigger screen, better battery life, apps better optimised for ios 

S25: smaller and lighter, 120hz feels snappier, 12gb ram should be more future proof, 3x telephoto lens, sideloading
i would go s25ultra if you wannah ave phone for years, definitely better then s24u and also surpassed iphone (with ai without a doubt)
I guess they both have their pros and cons
Thank you that's really helpful.
Ultra isn't an option too expensive for me
Exactly!
me personally would still go to s25 because i like flexibility of android and its newer phone. But tbh i didnt see bad review about pixel AT ALL
I found hundreds and hundreds of negative comments about the Pixel on Reddit alone and I did find a website that listed all of the issues with it and even the people that like it have said it's a mid range phone and a flagship price.",2025-02-05 12:14:05,2,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1ii8lpd/samsung_galaxy_s2425_or_iphone_16_plus/
Smartphones,Which smartphone is better to buy?,"Hi I'm looking to change my phone. I have been contemplating a lot and I am confused between the two phones. 
Pixel 9 and Samsung s25
Can you guys help me with which one is better ?

Here's direct comparasion, if it helps https://m.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=13219&idPhone2=13610
I own a pixel 7 and I consider them one of the best best buys (ip65, over 5 years of guaranteed updates...) however, looking at the AnTuTu comparative tests there is no doubt that the Samsung is better performing; on the other hand it is also true that the pixel costs around €230 less and is, objectively, a device with performances that are receiving a lot of praise. As for performance, I wonder if, in the hands of the end user, they are so evident. What for me is a further bonus point in favor of the pixel - in addition to the price - is the possibility of participating in the beta versions of the OS: for some it might be superfluous but for me it is extremely interesting and curious, not to mention all the Google devices which are achieving considerable success in terms of the quality/price ratio
I'd choose the P9 over the S24(but I'd choose the S25 over the P9) but I'd also choose the S25 Ultra over the P9P.
S25
The S25 ultra for sure. Better CPU, it's smoother etc.
Which one do you recommend? I don't play games. It's for simple regular use
Why I am not able to buy because in reviews I keep reading that pixel 9 is not a good phone. It has many issues. The only good thing is the camera. People vouch for Samsung. I have always wanted to buy pixel but these comments stop me from buying it.
Easiest one ever. Pixel 9 is slow af compare to s24 ultra. Compare to s25u, just dont
Oneplus or iPhone tho.
Why pick between the two worst phones on the market right now? They basically have the slowest charging, worst battery life and pixel even has straight up bad cpu, other than many games not even being able to run on such a weak phone (Grid Legends for example), its questionable how long the phone will remain smooth.
Pixel 9 pro deffo Samsung sux
iPhone
So much positive about pixel. Helped me make up my mind.
Second this
I'm considering this now as I miss my old note and the stylus pen. But I'm also afraid the big size it is really going to annoy me now that I'm used to operate my S22 with one gand for this long..
If you want an easy to use device that takes excellent pics then go Pixel. If you want a ton of customizations and the fastest processor then go Sammy. You really can't go wrong with either device at this point.
😆
go with pixel. i have the 9 it's great haven't had any issues. had a 4,7,7a no issues as well.
Slow in terms of what? And when does it get slow? While playing games?
Oh boy.. worst phones
Disclaimer: I am dangerously close to buying a wallet case; having said all this I will tell you: I paid objectively a foolish amount for the pixel 7, I use it for work therefore I need both battery and excellent connectivity and these two elements are both there. The screen is clear, the 90hz refresh is more than enough to watch HD content; wireless charging is stable and works pretty well even with magsafe compatible accessories (I have a case with the classic magnetic ring).  It has the ability to pause apps and monitor what happens in the background and, through the developer option, by bringing the visual effects to zero, it becomes a real rocket in terms of speed and reactivity, therefore the choice, in my opinion, depends on what you will have to do with your phone: for example, if its use will be mainly for video games, I would advise you to orient yourself directly towards a ROG, if instead you want a phone that simply works, well, take the pixel, if it were not for the guaranteed updates and the development of the AI that Google is undertaking, with extremely satisfactory results to date
To clarify something: don't look at a tutu scores, iphones which have the becy cpus for the last 10 years, score half of what samsungs score
My bad, it autocorrected to that. It's the  base s25 I'm referring to
Thanks that helps!
Everything, slower memory, chip, worst screen, and it has 2x the power in the benchmark. Here 9pro xl is around 5000 PLN and s25 ultra is 5500. U pay 10% more for a phone with 2x the specs.
What ""oh boy""? Can you name me worse Android 2024-5 flagships?   
  
All competition has better screens with morbidly higher PWM dimming for eye strain, 10 bit panels with twice the peak brightness for hdr/dolby vision (actually capable dolby vision displays, not just by cert), all of them are physically more durable, have higher IP69 rating, all of them have 2-3 times faster charging, 2-5 times faster wireless charging and noticeably better battery life due to much larger batteries, even cameras are better on the likes of Honor Magic7 Pro and Vivo x200 Pro according to every living reviewer, vs Pixel they all have better CPUs too, and vs Samsung while the same CPU actually most competition shows better stability, etc.
Ah, cheers. I'm also considering that one myself.
For peak brightness fast charging and wireless charging Sony Xperia 1 vi is worse lmao
Even for screen they worse they downgrade the 4k screen of the 1V For a FHD+ screen
Vivo is good but Honor xD? Maybe Xiaomi is better?
Man Xiaomi and Huawei put great hardware but have software on mid range phones level or maybe less. Bugs, a lot of problems with optimization, killing apps even if u update all settings, notifications problem and other things. Xiaomi was cheap but its a past, newest xiaomi ultra cost more than newest Iphone xD
No thanks for this garbage, i had in hand half year and more time i spent on fixing things in the system than actual use it
What do you mean ""but Honor""? Honor has by very far the best display on the market right now, having couple of tuv rheinland sertificates, 4320Hz PWM dimming, highest peak brightness in any phone, actual true dolby vision support, it is far more durable than competitors, is one of the rare flagships with IP69 certificate too, and camera is possibly the best in existence, even last years Magic6 Pro was ahead of all competition including iPhone 16 Pro Max, let alone new 7 Pro. Speakers are probably the best on the market too, which every reviewer I've heard said (and what I heard with my own ears too). Also performance show much more stable results in stress tests than most competition, except for Rog Phone 9 and Nubia, destroying even excellent OnePlus 13, let alone the likes of Samsung. Absolutely 0 problems with ""optimization"".

I'm confused what are you talking about. Weird.
Bla bla bla, i heard that a lot from huawei and xiaomi fanboys but when i tested both devices, it was disaster. They can put the most expensive and experimental camera setup and other hardware but when OS and optimalization sucks its just will be next mid range phone and the most expensive models from huawei and xiaomi are mid range or budget phones. MagicOS is just same as MIUI. System have bad algorithms and for example stock camera sucks but when i installed gcam all changes. Rest is just marketing and watching on you it seems to work lmao
Weird. I tried Xiaomi and it was far superior to Samsung or Pixel in every possible way, even software it had some nice stuff such as that paper texture reading mode and it eyes didn't hurt like with Samsung when reading in the evening on low brightness, also cameras were better for the most part (except for video recording). 

And no, I disagree with every word you said, and no, Honor's default camera is superior to any competition that I have ever seen, and what's more it's not just *my* eyes, but every serious reviewer (especially those that specialize in photography) said that too, and even last year's Magic6 Pro obliterated Samsung and was ahead of iPhone 16 Pro Max too on dxo mark. 

But yeah, disagreed with every word you said, and I am never coming back to inferior devices such as Samsung or Pixel. I just value my eyes too much looking at the phone like 3-4 hours a day, including some reading before sleep. S24 Ultra makes eye strain, and superior phones such as Honor do not - end of story. 

Good luck lying to yourself and justifying inferior devices by spreading misinformation about ""optimization"" lol.
The funniest thing is that in such long-winded texts you have not given a single argument why honor is better just everything is based on your dubious opinion. You haven't even tested the devices, only in such cameras you rely on the ridiculous dxomark, which boasted that whoever pays more is higher in their ranking, and the rest is your opinion. You probably haven't had other phones in your hand, but you have to praise what an honor it is great.

With all due respect, but you write in such a way that I would sooner trust a random dog on the street than you in any matter. Especially since 90% of what you write is nonsensical gibberish and everything you wanted to write can be fit into 1 or 2 sentences.
A pathetic type who for no reason will push his texts about honor without knowing anything. Maybe someday you will grow up because so far you are still a few years short of a fanboy. The important thing is that you are happy to buy a mid-range phone at the price of a flagship .
I have given reasons:   
1. The best display in existence, both for eye health and visually  
2. Better speakers than all Androids 2nd only to Asus ROG Phone 9  
3. Higher IP69 rating than most competition  
4. 2+ times faster charging than Samsung or Pixel for example  
5. Multiple times faster wireless charging  
6. Better battery life due to larger battery  
7. Cameras are subjective at this point, but even last years 6 Pro beat iPhone 16 Pro Max on dxomark and by most reviews I've seen  
8. Benchmarks show incomparably better performance than Pixel 9, and stability scores are better than Samsung S25U for example (91% vs 87% for wild mark stress test), usually meaning better cooling inside the phone.  
9. Better biometrics, has actual 3d tof sensor for face unlock, like on iPhone which no other Android flagship has

There is more, but I just named couple of extremely huge reasons. Superior display, superior sustained performance, better battery life with much faster charging, better speakers. 

I mean even ALL reviewers say that, just take a look at idk MKBHD's video from this morning that came out, check out any review. 

You are allowed to remain blind and say what you want, but once you hold in hand Honor or something you will know. I literally picked it in the shop next to competition after taking a look at the displays and build quality - it's just better.
1. Subjective opinion. Honor does not make its own screens but orders from companies like Samsung. Maybe the specifications are ""impressive"" so it does not translate into actual use and there are better screens on the market. Besides, others will say that the screen from Iphone the best, this is not an argument.
2. 90% of people don't give a damn about the quality of the speakers on their phones. No one listens to music through the speaker on the phone where there are already finger-sized wireless headphones and small portable speakers on the market. There are decent speakers in flagships sufficient for calls, and that's the last thing that matters.
3. Even if there will be IP1000 immunity capable of surviving a month on the ocean floor, no one will knowingly risk putting the phone in the water. The warranty does not cover flooding. Any bump or fall further compromises the integrity of the phone. So if someone cares about the equipment and does not buy a new one every now and then, he will not deliberately dive with the phone no matter how high the protection. Normally this is only to protect against accidental dropping into water.
4. This may be a plus, but it is also a minus because it causes faster battery degradation. I myself used to think that the faster the better but honestly why do you need it? In normal mode, everyone has windows for a longer charging time if only at night, but also during the day and few people constantly walk to be away from the outlet for days. No one comes into the house for 5m and leaves and then the same thing again and so 4x a day. 
Despite the speed, however, I prefer less battery degradation and longer endurance because there is still time to recharge. And for longer trips one takes a powerbank anyway
5. What you will rarely use and have to buy an expensive charger. A good organization of cables on the desk eliminates the problem of clutter rally so you are left to use it only in the car as long as you can find a suitable accessory holding the phone at this charging speed, and again this is another cost as opposed to cheap cables. Wireless charging needs to develop more, because for now it's an expensive game.
6. Larger battery but hopeless MagicOS overlay, which lacks much in the way of good optimization. It is not very different from such a Samsung. 
The honor magic 7 pro version has 5850 mAH.
In tests on GSMArena it achieved a score of 15:31h.

Samsung S24 Ultra has 5000 mAH, reached a score of 16:20h.

Even honor magic6 pro having 5600 mAH achieved a better result because 16:18h xDDDD. (STILL LESS THAN SAMSUNG XDDDDDDDD)

xDDDD

You are too stupid, you pay information to numbers, you see more and think it is better.
You want to know where quality goes with numbers? Oneplus 13 has 6000 mAH and reached 19:08h and that's more or less what Honor magic7 pro should achieve

7. Dxomark is no test as there you could pay yourself to be ranked higher xD

8. No one will notice the difference even in demanding games. You stated it simply to argue, and in everyday use, it does not matter.
If you tell people about it, the placebo effect will work and they will believe that Honor has supposedly a few % better performance score, and in daily I guarantee you that Samsung/Oneplus or Vivo will get more votes because with them the overlay and system work better and smoother than in this pseudo-MIUI aka magicos

9. Ridiculous are these face unlocks as if it makes sense and meaningful. These scanners go to fool ;) 
I prefer fingerprint unlocking, it's more secure and just as fast as if I had to show my face. 
This is not an argument just a simple matter of taste.

And these are your arguments? 7 of them made up, by force, unsupported by anything but bigger numbers on the manufacturer's website, leaving aside those arguments that are only subjective and tailored to the person. 
Learn kid what are arguments and how to cite them in conversation to include the real reason behind them.
And not because you see that the screen is the prettiest, you see that the battery has a higher capacity (and still drains faster relative to phones with a smaller battery xD), omitting to give pseudo sources.

You are pathetic and spare yourself the further embarrassment of your person",2025-02-05 11:56:26,4,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1ii8bls/which_smartphone_is_better_to_buy/
Smartphones,16 pro max vs Pixel 9 PXL vs S24 Ultra - Which to pick?,"So currently II am trying to find a new phone, I already have the 16 pro max and the Pixel 9 pro xl and I have been comparing them, theyre really close but after the cool factor of never experiencing iOS I feel like the phone feels limited in what you can do, the pixel can do way more and it's like 400 less give or take.

Between these 2 I think the 16 pro max takes better photos they have more detail especially when you zoom in but the pixel outside tends to have nicer colors. For selfies the pixel tends to add an invisible filter making my skin really pink or red and make them bright when it's not bright at all, or taking pictures of birds in the sky they have white outlines while the iphone doesnt. Makes it harder. OS wise android feels way snappier iOS feels a bit slow and clunky compared to pixel oh and so much animations, disabling helped a lil bit.

I was deciding swapping for a s24 ultra since I heard it's the best of both worlds?

s24 ultra 899 eur

pixel 9 pro xl 899 eur

iphone 16 pro max 1289 euro

These are the prices.

Comments:
Pixel 9 pro has a mid range processor. It loses badly on the longevity front (since the processor will start showing its age in 2 years, it's basically comparable to a SD 8 Gen 1 in the s22 series speed wise).

It is also much less versatile as a camera than the S24 Ultra, despite the fandom. The S24 Ultra objectively takes better videos, better portraits with superior depth mapping and edge detection, and better 3x shots due to an extra sensor. Better 10x shots as well.

The pixel takes slightly better night shots, less noise and handles motion blur better, but you can get that benefit on the S24 Ultra if you install gcam. The pixel has literally no camera benefit over the S24 Ultra since you can install gcam on it. The s24 ultra also has the benefit of a Bluetooth s pen. 

It's basically between the S24 Ultra and iPhone. I would vote Ultra because of the price difference. Of course OS is a personal choice you need to make.
Galaxy S24U and its snapdragon is a safe bet imo
I am trying to make a similar decision. I would choose the Pixel over the Samsung.

However, choosing between the iPhone and the Pixel is a much harder decision. I have never owned a Pixel but I have owned various iPhone models over the years.

I have read very mixed things about both the Pixel and the iPhone. I decide on one then find something that changes my mind again. If you prefer Android and want to save money get the Pixel.

I don't have preference between iOS and Android at all so that doesn't help my decision.
I heard it has a grainy screen
Maybe I can help you, I've been playing around with both and what I think is the iPhone has a better camera the images have more detail especially when you zoom in. The Pixel usually has more accurate colors but with skin it's like you have a lot of filters applied and heavy processing.

I did compile some examples that I've done here [https://imgur.com/a/G7oPCc7](https://imgur.com/a/G7oPCc7)

For gaming I've tried NFS, call of duty etc on both and they run more than fine no differences, genshin ran great on the iPhone.

I feel like software wise the Pixel offers way more, it feels snappier faster to control/use apps. I feel so limited on the iPhone even from just scaling widgets or sizing icons etc there is almost nothing you can do other than 1 or 2 options that are presets. I'm not used to notifications either theyre normally always at the top for me but on iPhone theyre hidden in their own notifcation tray you dont see unless you pull down.

I still can't get used to iOS keyboard the keyboard on googles is so good and automatically swaps languages for me if i type in a different one.

Aesthetically I prefer the Pixel, Photos it's a 50/50, The detail the iPhone picks up especially in the seflie camera is better.. I can show pictures I took of my eye close up and the iPhone was way better in this scenario. Color wise it depends, outside pictures to pixel seems to be way more accurate but iPhone has a lot of nice filters.
Thank you! In terms of the limitation of iPhone software it's not something that has particularly bothered me, neither does the iOS keyboard. I like Pixel as it would be easier for me to move from MagicOS to Pixel. I don't use my phone for gaming so that's no issue to me. 

However, I have read the Pixel has issues with overheating, the battery is average at best. I have also read that the processor is a bit behind where it should be and a number of tech reviews have classed it as a good phone but is more mid range than flagship and it still has a way to go. The Pixel 10 is predicted to be a huge improvement but with a big price increase. I wouldn't want to spend a lot of money on the Pixel 9 if a much better one is coming soon. As for the iPhone 16 I was looking at the Plus model. I have read about numerous issues with the camera, lack of responsiveness, battery drain and the latest iOS being riddled with bugs.

I have owned 3 iPhones in the past one was the best phone I have ever owned but the other 2 were rubbish. I have also owned a few different Samsung phones both flagship and mid range and they all needed replacing in under 2 yrs due to software issues. So I gave up on Samsung. I currently have a budget Honor phone which is perfectly fine but does potentially have unstable signal (common Honor issue) and the camera isn't the best.

Both Pixel and iPhone clearly have their issues and neither are perfect but I am hoping saving up and buying a flagship phone it will last for a number of years I'm just struggling to decide which one to spend so much money on.
Regarding the pixels processing power, yes it's behind tensor is not that great but the optmisation is very well done and the phone feels snapier and faster to me than the iPhone.

From my personal experience over the last week I've not ran into bugs with either phone and great are good choices.

If they are around the same price I'd go for the iPhone probably. If it's like 400-500 difference I'd go for the pixel.

As for overheating no that's not a problem on either of the phones from what I've experienced so far. Charging gets a little hot on both but during use I don't notice at all.
Thank you. I think I'm leaning towards the iPhone.",2025-02-04 18:05:40,1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1iho1w4/16_pro_max_vs_pixel_9_pxl_vs_s24_ultra_which_to/
Smartphones,"iPhone 16 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro, or Galaxy S25? Reposting Now That the S25 Is Out","Hey everyone, sorry for the repost, but now that the Galaxy S25 is officially out, I wanted to reconsider my options with fresh eyes.

I’m currently debating between:

iPhone 16 Pro – Premium design, fluid ecosystem, long software support, but super expensive, and Apple Intelligence isn’t even available in Europe yet. iOS 18 looks solid, but I’d lose Android’s flexibility. Also, I’ve heard typing on iOS can be kind of annoying, which makes me hesitant since I type a lot.

Pixel 9 Pro – Great camera and battery, but stock Android is just not it for me. I can’t handle Android stock as is—it’s too barebones and honestly kind of ugly. I’d 100% have to put Nova Launcher or something similar to make it feel decent.

Galaxy S25 – Best price-to-value ratio, One UI is polished, and Gemini AI is integrated. Samsung is also offering double storage + earbuds for HALF the price of the iPhone if I preorder. My only hesitation is the design—I'm not a fan of the three vertically aligned cameras. (Should I wait for the S25 Edge ?)


Right now, I’m using a Galaxy S9 from 2018, and it's finally starting to give up on me. So whatever I pick, I need it to last at least another 5+ years.

I have no real preference—I just don’t want to regret staying with Samsung or switching to something new. The Pixel is tempting for the camera and battery, the iPhone 16 Pro looks and feels premium, and the S25 is just an insane deal right now.

Hoping someone can help me decide before tomorrow, because Samsung’s preorder offer ends in 48 hours, hahaha. (Not saying I’m leaning toward it, but, well, you know how it is...)

Thank you !!



Comments:
First of all S25 Edge will probably be less powerful or have fewer feature than the base S25, similar to FE’s. I have had iPhones for the last 9 years, I wouldn’t recommend iPhones at all, they artificially and unnecessarily restrict the usability of your device especially with other devices let’s say Windows as an example. And I’m not even talking about planned slow down after precisely 3 years. You gotta give the animations and app design to Apple nonetheless; but I now would much prefer functionality over beauty. My next phone will be a pixel most likely to have a clean OS experience but you said you like One UI better which makes the S25 deal a no brainer!
iPhone > Samsung > Pixel
If camera quality is important to you, stay away from the S25. It's worse than my old Galaxy A52s. Other than that, the S25 has great performance, great screen and it's very compact and light.
My opinion is that Pixel 9 Pro is sweet software wise. I feel the tensor chips could be a tad better, but let's be honest, do you really need all that power like snapdragon Gen 3 or in s25 case the elite? Most don't anyone who saids they do is fairly rare on if that is truly true. As for iPhone, there software is very limiting unless you're in an ecosystem. im no big fan, and i will say i do like the stableness though and optimization of apps apple offers. As for samsung s25. I have the s24 what im typing on, and im agitated with one u.i 7 still not being released for us, and they already had to delay android 15, and pixels had it for a while now With all that being said. I would rather have Pixel 9 Pro. I may sell my s24 and go get one, to be honest. Sick of samsung and their software. And I have been using Beta 3 for a while, waiting on stable release and the bugs I've run into or issues. Yeah, I'm not a big fan.
OnePlus 13 - beats them all!
Consider OnePlus 13 or Honor magic 7 pro? I'd get one of those. I got the Honor and it's amazing!
So I was stuck between a P9 pro and S25 for a while. Similar dilemma; S25 pre order came with double the storage, a watch 7 and 200 EUR cheaper than the P9 Pro. I bit the bullet and ordered it. Still waiting. In the mean time, I realised, I do not want to pay that extra 200 no matter what, BUT I want good photos. So I started looking at the P9. And I am still looking while waiting on the Pre-order. 

It came down to, customization, future-proofing (SoC) and zoom vs Photo quality and fast updates. 

Still debating which to keep. What's your take?
I have a similar question. I decided against Samsung (past experiences). I was initially leaning towards the Pixel but then I have read some very mixed things about it which put me off and I decided on iPhone.

Then I read multiple posts, forums and articles stating  there's a whole host of issues with the iPhone 16 range and the current iOS is super buggy so now I'm super confused.

I currently have a budget phone which is fine but camera stabilisation is rubbish and so is the quality of photos taken on zoom and the brand has some known issue with unstable phone signal which I think I maybe experiencing.
I will vote for Pixel.
Take pixel or iphone, apple intelligence eventually will come to europe in beginning of april 2025. 

Samsung on the other hand will charge for ai by the end of 2025. 

Also iPhone is not as bad as described. It is a little expensive and they indeed artificially restrict things but however it is always stable and will last a very long time, even when sold after 1/2y the resale value is higher than samsung for example. 

Maybe try the iphone 16? Or wait for the iphone se2025 coming march.
Samsung


But how about oneplus 13??
Depends. Samsung or Pixel. But all 3d party apps are much much better on IOS.
Vote for Samsung
You literally picked between the 3 worst phones out right now. Every other Android flagship is directly superior. These are the 3 slowest charging phones on the market, they don't have competitive battery life too looking at latest \~5600-6500 mAh batteries found in other flagships. Cameras lag behind even the last years competition such as Honor Magic6 Pro, let alone latest 7 Pro, Huawei, both last year Vivo as well as latest x200 Pro, performance while decent (except for Pixel's weak CPU) is not that great when it comes to stability, losing to virtually all 8 Elite competitors, etc. 

  
Honor Magic7 pro (superior camera, superior screen, sustained performance, battery, charging speed), Vivo x200 Pro (far better cameras, battery, etc, same as for Honor), OnePlus 13 (better display than all 3 phones you named, 2-3 times faster charging, longer battery life, better durability and IP resistance, etc.).
That’s exactly the kind of response I was expecting!

For me, changing phones every 1-2 years through Apple Trade-In wouldn’t be an issue if I were fully invested in the Apple ecosystem. But I just don’t know if it’s worth it or if I’d regret the switch.

I could probably do the same with a Pixel or Samsung, but I feel like Apple holds its value better over time. Not sure if upgrading frequently with Android phones would be as smooth. What do you think?
Same program obsolescence with pixel…
You talk so much crap. They dont slow down. They tune the software to not drain the battery too fast and thats why iPhones out last androids after the 4 year mark.  Your are not stuck in iOS. If you want to completely Change your phone with launchers and stuff then sure. But a Guy in his 20s why would he spend so much time customizing a phone. I did that when i was 14. iOS is so freakin good. Polished. You dont need a launcher if the os from the start is already top tier. I would say iPhone. I use both Samsung. iPhone and oneplus. Oneplus over Samsung. But iPhone over oneplus. The speakers. The software and the battery optimizing of the battery is so good
I like the little stuff from OneUI. Pixel feels a bit boring like iOS.

I got the s25 ultra and so far zero regrets!
Iphone > pixel > samsung


Have iphone and pixel

Samsung is just a lot bloatware and petty hardware that goes off in few years

My iphone 6 still loves (12 years). I had to replace it cuz of peer pressure
Did you mean <?
Samsung > LG > HTC > Sony > Motorola > Nokia > iPhone > Pixel.
Tested out an s25 in shop, didnt seem bad quality at all, at least from the phone. what I noticed tho…when taking a close up shot it couldnt focus on text even when putting on ultrawide manually, it just kept flickering. Whereas iphone 16 models had no problems at all. Maybe its a software issue idk
Exactly, you probably don’t need all the raw power the snapdragon chips in Samsung bring. The pixel OS is lighter which I believe should be more efficient than OneUI, meaning you still can have almost if not as smooth an experience on pixel
I also pre-ordered the S25 base model (512GB) with Buds 3 Pro for €850, but I'm still debating whether to return it and get the Pixel 9 Pro instead for its camera and unique design.

Right now, my S25 will basically look like an A55, A35, S24, S23, etc., and honestly, I don’t love that uniform design. I hope I’ll get used to the squared-off corners—I haven’t seen a phone shaped like this since the Galaxy Alpha in 2016 hahah. Every phone I’ve had since then has been more rounded and ergonomic (Blackberry 👀, S4, S6 Edge, S9), so this feels like a shift.

I might just give Samsung a chance because, at the end of the day, I don’t want to pay €1000 for just a phone and still have no perfectly matching earbuds. I know that Samsung Buds work with Pixels but they don't perfectly due to codec differences, but it's probably imperceptible in real-world use...I don't know

When it comes to camera differences, it mostly comes down to the telephoto lens, which I’m not sure I’d use all the time in daily life. But hey, a top-tier camera is always welcome, and that’s (with the Android Stock) what’s making me hesitate...

I also hope that by then, Android will allow for deeper native customization, so I don’t have to rely on launchers or third-party apps that work half the time. Let’s be honest, compared to the Android Stock, One UI is really attractive, whether it’s useful or not...

That being said, it’s not like the S25 is a bad phone—far from it. It’s just a budget issue, and my S9 is dying on me at the worst possible time, hahaha. I need to calm down my impulse buying and indecisiveness, so I think I’ll just keep it, give it a chance, and see how things evolve. Who knows, maybe I’ll trade it for a Flip 7 later on? Hahaha.

Anyway, sorry if I got a bit long-winded, I’m thinking while typing. What about you, have you made a final decision?
I totally get you—every time I decide on something, I come across contradictory reviews and end up back at square one. It’s normal, but at some point, we just have to make a choice and take the least amount of damage possible.

One issue with the Pixel is that the Pixel Buds are pretty bad, so I’d have to buy Samsung Buds instead, which I’m not even sure are fully compatible. Probably yes, but I don’t like having to jump through hoops just to get everything working smoothly.

At least Samsung and Apple have well-developed ecosystems, so everything is plug-and-play. But damn, the Pixel’s camera is a beast, no denying that.

That said, I wonder if Samsung or Apple do a better job optimizing the camera software than Google. Pixel is amazing at computational photography, but Apple and Samsung seem to have better balance in terms of consistency and video quality. What do you think?
Tsss one plus 13 one of the best 👌🏽👌🏽
If OP lives in the US then most of those brands you named are inconvient. I would own a vivo right now if it was more readily available in the us. You can't just walk into a phone carrier and get one of those phones in the US. Hell I don't even know what you would do if you need some kind of support or repair.
We can’t get those phones here. It’s apple, Samsung and Google only. No Chinese phones
I’m not that informed on trade in programs. Go check their websites see how much for example Samsung will give you for an S24 to get an S25 and iPhone 15 for iPhone 16.
Samsung has a great trade in program. I'm in Europe and they offered 500€ (450$) for my s24. It costed me 600€(550$) last year, plus got the buds pro for free and a cover.

If you're in the US, i think the trade in is even better. I seen people paying a fraction of the price.
What?! Actually dude? I thought I was going to make good my escape from programmed obsolescence. I’m extremely disappointed and discouraged to hear that. How about Samsung S series?
Is the camera bad like some people say ?
Why pixel is the last ?
Facts. I hate samsung software more and more with android 15 and there lackluster effort to get it good and solid. I prefer a moto g stylus 5g 2024 I got for fun over my s24 a lot of times lol. Yes not as powerful as the flagship but noticed i never need all the power. I use to care to have the best of the best. But as im getting older I realized who cares.
No worries at all. I'm happy to finally hear someone else has the same thought process.

Well I still haven't gotten mine. And the pixel 9 Pro deal is over so that's not happening for sure.

What I keep thinking is when my s25 arrives, I'll order a P9 and do my own comparison as these online comparisons aren't always reliable. And keep one of them based off that.

Like you said, S25 is really not a bad phone. Actually it's a great all around phone. One UI is indeed more polished actually and I really don't mind the extra apps. A great example is being able to connect 2 bluetooth outputs to share content with a friend on a flight. I mean how many times a year will you use that if ever, but still naice to have.

Zoom is very useful too, and I've always felt on my current device I wish I could go beyond 2x. So S25 gets a big plus there. But general image quality is way more important and from YouTube comparisons I see that S25 has image quality from a few years ago. The main issues being colour science (just not appealing to the eye), shutter lag (forget taking photos of kids or pets indoors or at night), and strange artifacts in challenging light conditions, the worst being purple fringing that reminds me of my HTC One. In summary: zoom vs image quality. The P9 Pro would've made this choice easy but that's off the table now. I think I still tend towards image quality.

Then there's the SoC and longevity side. I think that generally S25 will outlast the P9, but that's just a bet at this point. Of course if you game those intensive games then it's a no brainer, S25 wins.

The P9 has a bigger and brighter display but does not go as dim as S25, a feature I was really excited about since I am one of those people that linger on YouTube before bed. P9 has a longer battery life, in average a couple hours extra. But it charges wirelessly at a slower pace with qi chargers. Probably negligible difference.

Timely updates are another big plus. But also a minus that tends to introduce early buds. 

I think I might also keep it if the difference isn't too big between S25 and P9 and trade it for a P10 or P11. Hopefully by then more google call features will be available in Europe.

Here's my TLDR:
Switch to P9
+ Better photos
+ Bigger battery
+ Bigger screen
+ Brighter screen
+ Faster software updates

- brighter screen at night
- half storage
- no watch
- slower SoC 
- worse zoom photos
- slower wireless charging
I was decided on the iPhone 16 Plus over Google Pixel. From what I have read the Google Pixel phones have some really good strong points but still has a long way to go and is overpriced for the device you get.

However, I have had mixed experiences with iPhone in the past so I'm worried about being disappointed after spending so much money, but I definitely want a higher end phone next time.
Can't get them where? They all have global versions and are totally fine to use anywhere in the world, except for Huawei phones that due to US ban had to use inferior CPUs and resort to their own OS. Such a shame it's only those 3 you can get, they are literally the worst picks atm on the entire market. If you are fine with SD 8 gen 3 instead of 8 Elite, can you at least get a Sony? It has much better display, higher build quality and even has some handy stuff such as MicroSD card slot and 3.5mm jack for hifi iems, also has much better camera if you know how to use their alpha software and know a bit about photography.
That is impressive!

Just search on Google or Reddit; at least with an iPhone, even if there’s planned obsolescence, the resale price will be better than other brands. I liked Google phones when other manufacturers were making them for great quality, but now I just buy iPhones since all of them are practicing planned obsolescence.
No. It's very good.

Here's an example of point and shot with a bit of edition:

https://quickshare.samsungcloud.com/ch4HeAnKnhVn
Lame phones with a boring OS
Omg I’m exactly the same. As getting older the raw power and all those numbers become less important to me. How the phone functions is way more important
Keep me updated hahah i will probably do the same before the 14 days where i can return the S25 come to an end
No the carriers do not offer Sony. You’d have to buy the phone outright and hope it’s compatible with the network. I’m in Canada. Very limited options from the phone companies
It should be compatibile with all networks around the world, I always avoid carriers anyways as they often lock phone to their sim, and have their own layer of pushing updates and stuff. Global sim-free versions always only. 

But yeah, shame its only those phones, they are seriously behind all competition. 

Out of those Id pick Samsung
In Canada it’s illegal to lock the phone. All phones come unlocked from the phone company
I remember this was a thing 10-15 years ago, maybe. But some of US things are weird, and vica versa. 

Most of these phones accept eSIM, so there are possibilities for sure. And if not, maybe it’s time to support some of the smaller carriers.
All the small carriers are owned by the big ones. There’s literally 3 companies in Canada that own the entire spectrum. Telus, Bell and Roger’s",2025-02-04 13:24:13,6,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1ihhjt9/iphone_16_pro_pixel_9_pro_or_galaxy_s25_reposting/
Smartphones,Google vs. Samsung (Pixel 9 Pro vs S25 base),"Hello,
I am currently using Pixel 9 Pro but i am a bit disappointed with missing features (for example Screenshots and Studio) as I am not in the US. It feels like I paid for stuff that I did not really get.

Do you have an experience of how these two companies handle implementing features to smaller countries?

I am thinking of switching from P9P (which I can still return) to S25. What I am looking for are good cameras, longevity, decent battery life and smaller size. I dont game much but if I do, Teamfight Tactics is the most demanding game. I want good cameras to capture pictures of my baby growing up so it will be soon in constant motion.

Any recommendations please?

Comments:
Yeah, a lot of presentations last year from tech giants with phones, all the new features were ""coming soon."" Some countires get those new features sooner than others. I know here in Canada, I think unless you're apart of the beta program, you'll get those features months if not almost a year down the line. 

I think the S25 will be more than fine. Sure, the Pixel photo capabilities are better than Samsung and iPhone. But, sometimes it's a thin-hair notice. The S25 will do more than fine in my opinion for what you want to do. The S25 will last you for years. Being a current Pixel (8s) user, I'm not sure if I really believe in Google when they say the 8a and 9 are secured for 7yrs of updates. I'm not even sure the Tensor chips will be able to keep up. 

In my opinion get the S25. I love Pixel phones, but I know that Google still has catching up to do. Even though the Pixel 10, they'll have TSMC, I seriously think it's going to take a few generations for them to fully unleash their capabilities with their new chips and software. 

The S25 is a safe pick for long term use. I'm also considering getting the S25.
Thank you for your reply.

I tend to keep the phone until the use of it gets annoying. So when it starts to stutter or het auap on regular tasks, then I look to buy a new phone. Or when something stops working. That is why I am thinking of actually buying some more future proofed phone and as you mentioned, the Tensor chip is not promising in this regard. And since it hass been ""tuned"" for AI which I can not use or I have to download an apk and switch phone language, which then switches language of other apps in different environments (like WhatsApp), it gets a bit annoying. It is not like I can't understand the language but it is of course more comfortable for me to use my native language.

I heard from some YouTube cell phone reviewer that Pixel 10 SoC would be more on the level of Exynos from S24 maybe. Not sure if it is true though.

I might give S25 a try.

Smartphones,Your recommendation: Pixel 9 pro or Oppo find x8 pro ?,"After five an a half years, I need a new phone. I selected these two options because I can get them more or less at the same price at a discount. Also:

- I'm not a heavy user, maybe 2'5h average of screen per day.

- I love photography (photo, video, edit...). 

- I'm not a gamer. But I can use it for debugging. 

- I take care of things and I try to keep phones for at least 5-6 years. Durability it's important. 

- I also value good audio quality (speakers, mic and headphones). 

- Eye health it's also important. 

I searched a lot about these phones, but I would like to know the opinion of people who ideally has tested both (or at least one of them). 

Please, help me decide arguing your answer. Thank you.

I've never tried any, but personally I would take the Oppo, no offense to Pixel ofc. Takes great shots and great video and has better chipset.
Pixel 9 pro or s25+
Check the vivo x200 pro/mini

Smartphones,2025 smartphone advice - Samsung S25+ vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro vs. OnePlus 13,"Currently owning a OnePlus 5T in the UAE.

Have been looking at all the above phones online for the past month and am eternally confused. They all have different specs at different price points.

I can usually hold a phone for a good period of time. My current device was purchased back in 2017 and the only reason I have to change now is due to my failing battery. The OnePlus 5T is truly an amazing device, with the best thing being that placement of the biometric finger reader (at the phone's rear - I wonder why no other phone has replicated this!)

Coming back to topic, here are my observations for all 3 devices -  
Google Pixel 9 Pro - I've heard excellent reviews of this phone, but the fact that it's Google's makes me want to reconsider it  
OnePlus 13 - It isn't officially available in the UAE so there's no way for me to check it out before buying. Being an existing OnePlus user, I do trust their OS and hardware. Also, the fast charging and 6000 mah battery is unparalleled. Only lacking issue I've ever had with the OnePlus is their camera.  
Samsung S25+ - AI is advertised as excellent, but not sure if it's pragmatic. It's the most expensive of the lot. But I've heard the experience is one of the best among Android.

Please can someone with relevant experience/expertise guide.

**Edit/Update 08 Feb '25**:   
I have narrowed down my choices; but face the below dilemma now -  
OnePlus13 - I have decided to go for this. But since they're not officially selling in the UAE, I have been advised to refrain from getting the international versions since repairs will not be covered due to a lack of authorised service centres in the UAE.

Samsung S25+ - They have authorised sellers and repair centres in the UAE, but I don't really want to go for it.

I once again ask the community for their guidance. 



Comments:
Im in your same boat. The only difference is that im not even considering samsung due to its hefty price tag for nothing. Ai is not a game changer for me

During my search, i concluded that although camera specs are the same, the pixel camera software is way better. On the other hand the battery and charging speed of oneplus 13 is unparalleled. 

So dunno if i should get a pixel phone for a better camera or else a oneplus for a still pretty decent camera but way better battery charging speed & life.

Would like to see the opinions of others. Im a long time oneplus user, and very happy with their phones and particular features such as the side slider (to change audio modes) and as it is, im leaning more towards oneplus 13
You look like you value longevity a lot, that's why I think you should avoid the Pixel. The tensor chip might be good right now, but people have reported slowdowns in the Pixel 7 series, so I guess the 9 series will not last long. If you want to go Pixel I would wait for next year when they (allegedly) release a chip from TSMC. And to be totally frank, I might be biased, but I don't find the Pixel to be worth the price anyway. Like I guess the cameras are nice, but that's it. And most AI features are only supported in the US so that's a bummer.

Between the OnePlus 13 and S25+, each one has their pros and cons. The OnePlus has significantly better battery life and charging, lower price, slightly faster GPU, and the IR blaster with the mute switch are nice bonuses. Some also prefer OnePlus Hasselblad colors in still photos. The S25+ is better in videos, social media camera support (Instagram, Snapchat, etc.), software support (7 years), slightly faster CPU, and AI (if you care about it). Dex and UWB are some nice bonuses. 

Now for the subjective stuff, I'mma tell you my opinion but you should make your own judgement. I find the design of the Samsung to be better because it is lighter, has a flat screen (you might prefer the slight curve on OnePlus), and smaller in size due to the higher screen to body ratio. For software features, I don't really care that much about Dex or Galaxy AI (you might tho). I have both a OnePlus 8t and an S21, and I slightly like OxygenOS more than One UI. BUT I have the older OxygenOS 14 and One UI 6.1. People say the new updates are huge on both phones so my opinion is not up to date. Maybe watch some Youtube comparison to decide on the software front. 

To be honest, this comparison essentially boils down to two questions. Do you care more about AI, longer software support, and video quality **OR** better battery & charging, the mute switch, and lower price? Do you prefer OxygenOS **OR** OneUI?

For me, because I have a very messy lifestyle and I always charge my phone last minute, I literally can't live without Warp Charge on my OnePlus 8t. I also use the mute switch a lot while in lectures, and there are some OxygenOS features I use daily. This is why, personally, I would pick the OnePlus 13. But it's your call to decide from what I've laid out above.
If you were to compare oneplus 13 to S25 plus, then oneplus 13 would be be a better choice. I have seen both of them in person and oneplus 13 has a better display and software overall. But cameras are better on S25 plus.
Thank you. 

One of the biggest limitations I am currently facing is the inability to check out the OnePlus 13 on display at any of the stores. This is because OnePlus officially doesn't sell in the UAE and so I'd have to order it online from the US store. In hindsight though, I did check out the S25+ and didn't really spend more than a couple of minutes on it, because really, what can one check by looking at it other than a feel that it gives.

I myself am leaning towards the OnePlus.
I have Pixel 9 pro now but trying the oneplus 13 out for a bit.1 (day)....I'm sending it back though in a couple days just waiting for the packing slip from OP Which is ridiculous to have to wait 2-3 days?. The reason for my decision is in the quick settings area they put stupidest idea to place the dim and volume button on the far right and I constantly touch both or one of them when swiping down from the top. It's very annoying to me anyhow.

The camera wasn't bad, but I don't really photo that much. The haptics are fantastic, setting up is a breeze also. The screen is sharp and bright, it is thinner than the OP12. Oh and if anything goes wrong with the phone? Good luck getting support and they are the worse ever with dealing with. Actually it took me 45 minutes to get an agent to help with the return. I suggest though if you choose the OP13 to have best buy fix it rather than oneplus as I sent my OP11 to them to get it fixeed and I got it back roughly 2 months later and it wasn't even my device that I sent them as it had a different IMEI number on it. The phone looked like they got it out of the gargage or something because it had scratches on it?

I thought I'd give them another chance but after what I've been through this is one other reason i'm sending it back..I am looking into the S25 plus though and wondering if it's better than the pixel 9 pro? Samsung website you get 100.00 to spend on accessories and the price of the accessories are half off. I tried this and got 1 screen protector, 4 cases along with trade in $400.00 for my pixel 9 pro...Still deciding though?

Sorry it's so long but just giving you my 2 cents..Good Luck
Honestly, a blind buy is ok. I'm sure if you were to buy the OnePlus you would have no unpleasant surprises. Maybe just the feel of the phone as you said. 

Phones have mostly hit a hard wall of diminishing returns. Imo it's all about the small quality of life features that sets each one apart these days. So if you're leaning towards the OnePlus, I would say go for it and save some money too. You'll never regret it. Just be sure to buy one with a charger because I think they removed the charger in some regions (maybe the UK?).

Apple is no option, e.g. cuz of the Android Devices i love above.

So im kinda between the s25u which Yin und yangs between great 7 years of Support but also no Relevant new Features, so im having a hard time Pressing the buy Button for the approx 1200 euros tho it has the monthly option to pay for 0% price increase on the homepage.

Xiaomi 14t pro sounds very nice for its price, but there im not familiar with hyperos, and im not Sure if i might regret switching to a copy of Android which might stumble into Problems (copy not in a bad way tho..)

Pixel 9 pro xl has a very nice design and is a bit more attractive in terms of costs, so also in the top 3.

Im open to New Inputs and ideas,  experiences and so on.

Budget: around 1000€ as a point of orientation
Good camera would be great and keeping it for years is the goal.. Well i think all the phones in that price range has good battery life and camera so im having a hard time to name Priorities, lemme just hear your ideas.

Are you somewhere where you can get refurbs either from like, eBay or Amazon or something? What are the S23 phones looking like price-wise?
I'd recommend you get the S24U! Still a top-of-the-line phone with amazing support, great software & hardware, and it's ~$500 cheaper than the 25U.  You still get that signature sharp-edged screen and a Bluetooth S Pen!
If money it’s not an issue, get the S25U. According to reviewers, even tho the hardware is almost the same, they upgraded everything with software. Camera is noticeably better with the same hardware, screen is better, also has ProVision mode or what was it called that makes the image sharper via AI so lower res videos and photos will look better, better battery life thanks to better power efficiency of the sd 8 elite, finally slightly rounded corners so it will be much more comfortable to hold, slightly narrower than s24 so it will be easier to use with 1 hand, also narrower bezels, better speakers (they are louder and richer in sound). Also it has a vapor chamber bigger with 40% than s24 so it will have better thermals.

There is an upgrade in almost every way (besides the s-pen). If your life depends on s-pen bluetooth, go with s24U.

Personally I don’t like the vanilla android of the pixels, it feels cheap. Samsung One UI is way more refined and pleasant to use. That and the G4 tensor which is not at the level of today’s processors. I was thinking about pixel too, but too many drawbacks for me personally.

I’ve also been a oneplus user for 4.5 years and I can recommend it if you want to try out the Oneplus13. It’s a value for money beast. Idk if you can beat that.

I was in the same boat as you for 1-2 months. People were saying that s25U is trash and not worth and only bad things and crying a river over the s-pen, but i still ended preordering it. People will always complain. Just get what you like. Also if you plan to buy the s25U, do it from the mobile app and add the code APP5 for a 5% discount.
Located in germany so yeah thats an option, do you have experience with refurbished ones?

Edit: price Ranges are 450-500 for the s23
Of course, the s24u is also great since its just a little downstep to the New s25u, ill have to Look Further into it since it looked like i would only have to pay 200€ more for the s25u, so it was an idea i didnt follow for long. But ill keep it in mind!
Thanks for taking your time to share your experience, appreciate it much!
Yeah I love refurbished phones. In the US we have Swappa, so I buy my phones off of Swappa and eBay Refurbished. I also buy from eBay Used, but you have to specifically be familiar with eBay and with phones to make sure you're going to get what you thought you were going to get lol. Just make sure you read the description, that you're getting the right model

The good thing about the S23 series is you only have the Snapdragon model, so you don't have to worry about that part. Just make sure you don't get a carrier sim-locked model and don't get an S23 FE - get the base, the Plus, or the Ultra.

- Samsung: S8 (maybe add the Note8 into there). I remember thinking the design was so modern when it was released. I also loved the form factor when I used one, it was so premium while being slim and easy to hold.


- Apple: iPhone X - similar logic, it was the start of a new era for iPhone and just looked so modern when it came out.


- Google: Pixel 5 (best form factor ever) and Pixel 9 pro (a real small Android flagship and a marked improvement over previous Tensor pixels)
Motorola Defy+ was incredible at the time. 

And of course let's not forget the Nokia 8810, 8850 and 7110.
Now that's a list!!
How could I forget about the iPhone X! Good call there.
Thanks bro! I think your question was one of the best I've seen on here man. Very fun! Thank you for posting 🙂

Smartphones,Considering the switch from iPhone 16 Pro Max to Pixel 9 Pro XL,"Hi folks,

I’ve always been an iPhone user until XR, then I tried Android and lately I’ve returned to iPhone because I thought, and I still think, that third-party apps are simply more polished and optimized, but there are many things (regarding software) that I find better on Android. In addition, I don’t like iOS 18 at all since I had some issues. 

N.B. I’m not into mobile gaming and at the moment I don’t have other Apple devices. 

Therefore I’m considering to switch to Pixel Pro 9 XL. Did anybody do the same change?

If yes, I’d like to know how 9 Pro XL behaves regarding:

1) **battery life**: I bought the 16 Pro Max because I’ve read that battery life was incredible, but I don’t find that to be the case

2) **photos** I’m an amateur photographer and I like especially to take pictures of landscapes. I’m wondering also how 9 Pro XL scores regarding night/low light photos

3) does using the Pixel during the night cause eyestrain?

Thanks a lot!

Comments:
Yes made the jump
1. Great battery life
2. Photos are superior to iPhone. Great in low light and motion 
3. Has night light mode so very easy on the eyes. You can set brightness very low or very high it's like a beacon.
My advice would be wait 6 months for the pixel 10 to come out.
Hi man, thanks for your feedback, very interesting since you've made the same switch.  
I have a couple other questions, if you don't mind:

1. Did you experience any issue, such app freezing or lags while scrolling the screen or switching apps? What about the general performances in daily use, in comparison to 16 Pro Max?
2. Has the network reception always been good and reliable under 5G and Wi-Fi? No signal drops?
3. Can I use Gemini while the phone is locked?
4. What about the sound quality and overall loudness of the speakers?
5. Is Google Photos good for browsing the photo gallery? I've heard mixed opinions about that
6. Is it possible to enable an ad-blocker in Chrome? On the iPhone I was able to enable an ad-block extension (for Safari though)
7. Any heating issues? If I've understood well, that was a problem of previous Pixels

Thanks a lot!
1. None. Smoother than iPhone
2.reception is excellent 
3. I dont think so
4. Very good clear for calling and podcasts. Music is OK, but I use Bluetooth
5. I used google photos for years on my iphone. Even better on google.  The search function is amazing
6. Yes,I use one through a dns link.  You can use duckduckgo for sure. Chrome too
7. It gets a little warm when using plugged in high speed charging but that's it.  
Hope that helps
Awesome, thanks man!",2025-01-28 19:08:11,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1ic9f5o/considering_the_switch_from_iphone_16_pro_max_to/
Smartphones,Help me pick: S24 vs Pixel 9,"Hey there,

As the title suggests, I need help deciding which phone I should get.  
*I'm (finally) upgrading from my old pal Oneplus 6.*   
  
I don't care much about AI stuff, cameras, wireless charging. I want something that is well built, has a clean OS, will last me a few years with updates and it is fast with good battery time. I guess both fit in these requirements. I live in Europe so the S24 comes with Exynos processor. 
I prefer these 2 (base) models because of the ""smaller"" size.

Right now, I can buy the **S24** for **578,90 €** and the **Pixel 9** for **694,49 €**.

I tried them in a store recently and I liked both. So... please heeeeelp 😆

edit: more info

Comments:
S24. close thread.
If you are in america then s24. Snapdragon triumphs over tensor
OnePlus 13 is something unique with a badge friendly I recommende it
I'm actually facing similar decision going from an s21. Annoying that the comments don't seem to be helpful.

Just based on what other reviews it seems to be:

Pixel 9

\-better battery life? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx36JCVEprw&t=496s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx36JCVEprw&t=496s) I've looked up reviews and most would put the pixel 9 above. I'm guessing just because of the larger capacity. The exynos also seems to be signifigantly worse for battery life so all in the pixel 9 will problably have noticable better battery life.

\-better overall cameras, the only note is I've heard people saying they don't like the low light performance of the pixels.

\-better software? Something I'm looking forward to changing off of samsung is that while I don't hate one-ui there are parts I don't like. There are many apps that you can't uninstall and I generally prefer google apps over samsungs versions. There is also the aspect that pixels are the only real phones you can root and install custom roms in, so if you want to do that there is only one option.



S24:

\-more compact size: you'll know about this, the s24 is lighter and a bit smaller all around, since you mentioned liking that its worth noting that difference, even if it doesn't seem to be huge.

\-Better technical specs: On paper the s24 has a much better processor and also a newer standard of storage. How much this matters seems to be debated, but to me it doesn't seem like a large deal; I've also heard some people talk negatively about the s24s actual sustained performance when doing stuff like gaming, this will problably be more notable since you'd be buying the exynos version.

Most people say that there is maybe a tiny difference in every day use but its not signifigant. I've also seen people say that it will help with longevitiy as you have headroom for its processing to get weaker. However we've all used older phones and at this point there isn't ever a point where the processor becomes a weak point. My s21 is approaching 4 years old yet I've never noticed the processor getting slow despite many full android updates and use over the years. I think the limiting factor of old phones is usually battery degredation if anything.

\-better price, pretty obvious but there is a real price difference.

Other than that there doesn't seem to any obvious advantage in terms of hardware. I will say though I feel like if you are coming off a older oneplus (I myself used the OP7 pro for a while) you may like the pixels general ui, moving to one ui off of oxygen os was a rough transition.
Pixel 9. I believe it has better battery life.
yeah, Europe unfortunately :/
What's the price of s24+
742,90 € but tbh I want to keep the choice between the base models because of the size.
If you have a bad signal reception in your area, then it's samsung. But do consider the battery life and charging speed. 

Consider nothing 2a plus. If it's available.",2025-01-28 14:18:01,1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1ic2jfr/help_me_pick_s24_vs_pixel_9/
Smartphones,Need help choosing a new phone,"Hi,

I’m currently using an iPhone 8 Plus (I really like the Touch ID and the LCD screen, no burn-in issues), but I’m not sure if Apple still provides security updates for this model. Do you know if they’re still supporting it with updates?

If not, which phone should I consider buying? I’m debating between the iPhone 16 Plus, Pixel 9/9 Pro, or Galaxy S24 Ultra/S25 Ultra. Recently, I’ve heard a lot of complaints about the Pixel 4a and its poor update support, as well as Samsung phones with planned obsolescence. New iPhone have issues too when you look into it….

It’s been a long time since I’ve looked into the smartphone market, but back then, iOS apps were cleaner and more optimized.

Thanks for your advice!



Comments:
Pixel 9. You'll not regret it.
If you’re already semi-familiar with iOS and have an Apple account, I’d go for an iPhone 16 plus. I think it’d be the best experience
the [s24 ultra](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7?crid=39G91732PGTRA&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.p1gUp7chG_pqj1C1_rpzeJRILFYc3THRMYvkFtfLqGxk2vomnXsxN4QXyp6hQAjYJX8fU2UXyXf6qpZcoAxY9n-ctX3Taub4w5KhrKmB5lQL-Tb4l157DSLtdfnr4PInvVtRSwOuhvwGQRQn4P3eLIVNIT-U08yxoN6nPEcKkaQULhK60oa_SvVambzshG_koaDZPctW3dx7GOqKwpXG7JDwEbCDWxPk1uu9GsKnRK4.p_c7-Mu_oy2vH_QzfRFJXbUSH_ypoQ8dDfOKT8OhNQM&dib_tag=se&keywords=samsung%2Bs24%2Bultra&qid=1738046602&sprefix=samsung%2Bs24%2Bultr%2Caps%2C430&sr=8-1&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lps69-20&linkId=ed32fe7bc3a0ca6662f7f8e481a50425&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) would be a solid choice for you, its  a great phone if you prioritize features and are willing to go future proof
I much prefer android, but if I had it to do over again, I would t buy the S24U. It's an amazing device but I hate the screen and the feel of typing on it and the general size of it. I love a big screen but the phone is huge, thick and heavy.
Every phone companies do plan obsolescence, but the software update longevity on Android is very good nowadays.Both Samsung and Google now guarantee 7 years update on both the flagship and mid range models. I think it comes down to only one question; how much are you locked in Apple's ecosystem? My current daily driver is a Galaxy A33, a lower mid-ranger from 2022. It's still OK in day to day use, but I yearn for the simplicity of iOS so I'm waiting for the iPhone SE 4 now.
Thanks for your reply. Is there a difference between the pro and the other ? I hear their processor is not so great.. And Google phone is there planned obsolescence ?
I mostly use my phone for web browsing, genshin impact and watch videos.
Yes I was an android user before, and I got used to iOS and their limit and simplicity…
Now I’m not sure if it’s the best option… especially because I use a lot Google services. 6 years ago Google app were better on iOS than on android
this is a good option
Ok thanks
Yes, I went to iPhone with the iPhone 5s because at that time iOS app and the touchscreen interaction were better. I don’t know if nowadays if this this true…
Thanks for your reply.  
I try to use apps that are available on both platforms so I can switch anytime. 
A few years ago, iOS apps were a bit better than Android apps, including Google’s. The touchscreen fluidity was also more responsive on iOS, which is why I switched. 
Nowadays, though, if Pixel or Samsung had something as high-quality as FaceID, I wouldn’t hesitate to switch. 

Does this work for you?
The processor gets your daily tasks done. It's not the top of the line but still very much a flagship chip. Google devices have always been about the software, and they do plan on giving seven years of software support so it's far from planned obsolescence. 

If you do play Genshin, yeah I'll suggest getting the Samsung S24/S25 ultra as they're the all-rounder type, good for gaming too. They too have seven years of software support so it's great. 

I assumed you were a casual user, and that's something the pixel does best. Now that you mention Genshin, I'd recommend Samsung.
Well, I can’t speak for that. I’m not a Google user in any capacity, really. But, if you’re a Google user, you might not regret the Pixel :)
As someone who have been using Android since ver. 2.3 except when I daily-drived the iPhone SE 1 so Android kinda work for me more or less. I just want to go back iOS for no particularly reason.
Ok thanks you for your reply.
Well, nowadays I rarely play genshin. I don’t want this game to be the main factor to choose my phone.
I just want a phone I can trust with daily task without issues for 5 years… at least.
Ok thanks for the reply
Then I guess either choice won't hurt! Good luck with your purchase! The iPhone is good if you want to remain in the Apple ecosystem but isn't as value for money as the other options, so pick whatever you think will suit you the best!
Thanks for your reply.
Why do you say that iPhone isn’t as value for the money ?
You don't get the best in terms of specifications in comparison to the other options. Sure, it may have a better chipset than the Pixel but it has a worse display in comparison. That's just my opinion. But the choice is yours ultimately, as if you're comfortable with the Apple ecosystem then you can transition over seamlessly to the iPhone.
Thanks for the reply. Well I’m not a pro apple or anything. I don’t even use any paid app on iOS so I can change easily..it’s just I don’t want to make a bad choice because I will keep this phone for 5 years minimum….
Oh, in that case you can go for either of the options. What I've told you so far is what I believe is the value proposition you're getting for the price you pay, but all the options here will last you for five years or more, for sure. Basically, pick the iPhone for Apple benefits or exclusive things, the Samsung  if you want an all-rounder with great battery life, and the Pixel 9/9 Pro if you want great software and great cameras with the fastest OS updates, provided you use your phone for casual stuff.
Pretty much every sub flagship phone or better should carry you for 5 years processing power wise.
I, personally, won’t go for pixel 9 for two reasons.
1. Androids lose about 30% in first year. Pixel 8/8a is about half price of the Pixel 9.
2. Pixel is known for technical fuck ups. My pixel 4a become unusable because they shipped a bunch of devices with faulty batteries. And googling “Pixel 8 green screen” is an amusing experience. Buying Pixel on start is suboptimal.

Do you have a reason to keep the phone for exactly 5 years or more except for the price? If yes, go with the latest iPhone. They are solid, stable, better build quality, very nice all round rig with a good support and lifetime. If it’s about money, pick Pixel 8a or other similarly priced sub flagship - they will cover you just fine for half the price, and even if something brake in 3-4 years you just use the leftover funds and get another modern sub flagship.
Thanks you for the reply.
Is the price worth it for the difference in the processor and camera between pixel 9 and pro ?
I would recommend the 9 pro as it's rocking an LTPO display that is more power efficient, and a telephoto camera, and has more RAM. But if the price difference is huge, stick to the regular 9.
Thanks for your reply. The price difference is about 100€ for the same storage capacity.
Then it's completely up to you. If you think the differences are worth 100€, then go for the pro. Again, feel free to cross-check reviews of the phone on YouTube, especially the ones that mention they've used the phone for 3-6 months to confirm.",2025-01-28 04:55:38,3,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1ibtzqe/need_help_choosing_a_new_phone/
Smartphones,Upgrade from S22 Ultra,"Considering trading in my S22 Ultra, I've been with samsung since S10, but as everyone has said, the S25 is uninspired, and far from the upgrade I was hoping.

That being said, I'm still considering the upgrade as I can get a good trade value towards the S25 Ultra.

My choices are said S25 Ultra for little cost, Pixel 9 Pro XL for ""free"" (upgrade my verizon plan), or I'm considering the Oneplus 13, though I've seen conflicting posts about whether or not it is truly compatible with Verizon's BYOD.

Please offer your thoughts and what your choice is and why!


Update: I just ordered the Oneplus 13! Really excited to get it and see how it performs, thank you to those who replied and reassured the Oneplus is what I want.

Comments:
If your phone is working fine wait one more year. It is the time of half baked AI phones that don't do half of what they promise
OnePlus 13 

8/10 5G and all 4G bands
If you don't need an S Pen and want the best hardware for the money, One Plus 13 is the way to go. The software might not be as good/longevity in terms of updates but it's a beast.

If you want an S pen the s25 ultra is a great all around device with the best software.

Google makes good phones and good support but they charge a lot and you get a pretty mid range chip which I personally think isn't worth it.
Dont go with pixel 9 pro xl . It's camera is very average. I am gonna compare s25 ultra with other phones in the market . Do check out my channel https://youtube.com/@lenswars
would highly recommend you the [pixel 9 pro XL](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-XL-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HWR5QG?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.FXBUxkf_MpXwglYiiOAKQpcKqkiDksq7A6CulCTxTReMaxdZy_dzRKQHU1zfRqZCnqIRk-Y_jCQHcYsuBXSCXr14FDbjH5zGvpa_EdajAG-CwSmRvpQmhfwQMcjtXjixztE7WLa6sYPR3pxkZ5IT2hmNzp76DI4ityAsg2cawWx3SYPUXOm95J-UlAsp1sN8LRIp-swQ7VpYTbpZliL_rpfSaIY-Ak-Jylt115-CxMw.AwWAFOm72p5fZpe-MOK6PLpCVwCIb5R6rilN9ga_Vkc&dib_tag=se&keywords=Pixel%2B9%2BPro%2BXL&qid=1737959420&sr=8-3&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lps69-20&linkId=1eb62ed1b2c1dbbfdc9dd897c32e5104&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), its overall a very solid phone for the given price range.It’s a refreshing alternative to Samsung while costing you nothing with your plan upgrade.
That's why the Oneplus came onto my radar. My phones battery life is subpar, and I don't recieve half the calls that come through, and my bluetooth has gotten spotty.
Thanks! I've never had a Oneplus, but it appeals to me in the current generation. I thought I would use the S pen more when I got my S22, but it's been completely pointless for me.
this is a solid option to go for!

Smartphones,iPhone 16 Pro Max vs Google Pixel 9 Pro XL,"I'm looking for a new phone and I want suggestions between the 2. I currently have a google pixel 7 pro and it's kind of a let down to me after using it since release the battery dies really fast and there is some visual bugs in certain applications like a line going down the screen or some apps dont fully close etc. I tested to see if I traded it in how much value it'd retain and well.. I paid 1000 euro for it in 2023 and now it's barely worth 140 euro as a trade in or 240 euros on the 2nd hand market.

I'm comparing the iPhone 16 Pro Max to the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL

I don't know which to pick.

It seems the iPhone 16 Pro max is more of an all rounder with better video, really good photos etc better battery effiency and like double the performance in single and multicore.

Google Pixel 9 Pro XL I'm a bit hesitant after the value of my phone decreasing by like 90% and the issues with the battery draining and some random lines now and then it's not consitent and I don't know how to recreate it but it goes when I close and reopen the application.

16 Pro Max.
I should also add

iphone 16 pro max with trade in - 1116 euros

google pixel 9 pro with trade in - 705 euros

I ordered it and it’s due tomorrow but now I don’t know whether to keep it or return it. Part of me is really bored with iOS and their version of AI is pathetic, but the phone itself is great. The google AI looks so much more polished.

S24

Pixel 8 pro

Pixel 9

A55

iPhone 15

iPhone 16

They're all affordable on monthly payments. The A55 is 10chf per month and everything else is between 15 and 25 per month. 

I would prefer Android but if the iPhone 16 is significantly better than everything else I'll try it.

I currently have a Find X3 Pro that's getting long in the tooth.

I'd like battery to be decent so I don't have to charge halfway through the day. Fast charging is very convenient, I think the pixel only has 25w charging while my current phone has 65w.

I need the camera to be good for taking photos of my kids, a good macro would be an advantage. 

Most used apps are gonna be WhatsApp, Facebook messenger, Instagram, YouTube, Gmail, Google calendar and Google maps.

Pixel 9!
iPhone 16. If you want to keep it for longer. I’ve had bad experiences with android phones recently (pixel and oneplus). However if you are going to use yt/Spotify/games from other than official sources *wink* then take something with android.
I have been an android user for years but recently decided to save up for an iPhone. If you want high end and aren't bothered about the different OS I would suggest iPhone.

I personally have never had a good experience with any Samsung phone. I have read very mixed things about Google Pixel some say it is on par with iPhone so it's down to OS preference. Others say the Pixel isn't on par with the iPhone and are the same price.

I personally would narrow it down to iPhone or Pixel. If you prefer Android  go for Pixel if you like the iOS go with iPhone. In terms of model the iPhone 16 is on par with the iPhone 15.

I haven't owned an iPhone in years but own other Apple products. Currently using a budget phone which is suprisingly good but I'm saving up for an iPhone so I can buy that when this one dies.
You’d need to give more info on what you’re using it exactly for..
Pixel 9 if you are already into Android
S24.
> I need the camera to be good for taking photos of my kids

Don't get Samsung, it has a slow shutter speed issue which makes moving pictures (kids, pets) blurry.

It's not even fixed on S25 series. See [this video](https://youtu.be/pfUr5OHUTcs) at 11:17


> I would prefer Android but if the iPhone 16 is significantly better than everything else I'll try it.

> Most used apps are gonna be WhatsApp, Facebook messenger, Instagram, YouTube, Gmail, Google calendar and Google maps.

There's no point buying an IPhone 16, you'll be great with an either an IPhone 15, Pixel 8 Pro or Pixel 9

- IPhone 15 : overpriced for its features but great camera (especially for kids point and shot), iOS is also more optimized for social media apps (talking about camera app within the app for video call or stories for e.g)
- Pixel 8 Pro : Optical zoom lens, better battery
- Pixel 9 : better processor for longevity, better skin tones (see [this Pixel 8 Pro vs 9 Pro camera comparison](https://youtu.be/jSOgDvjKf1U)
I just picked up an S24 last week and I love it. Close 2nd place was the Pixel 9. I came from a Pixel 6 Pro and wanted to try something different.
Try the Pixel 9 Pro if possible or the S24
Pixel 9

Definitely
Pixel 9 for sure!
Judging by the fact that you haven't narrowed down the choice at all, it seems like you're not really into tech and will probably be happy with any of them.
All of them could probably get the job done but I’m leaning towards the pixel 9.
It has a 60hz screen so I'm removing it from the possibilities.
I'll update
The slow camera shutter speed can be a deal breaker for OP kid photography use case.
How bad is the processor on the pixel 8 pro? 

because I'm seeing a lot of negativity about it in reviews but at the same time I've been happy with this find X3 pro until the last Android update and that was released in 2021 so I'm not sure how picky those reviews are being. 

I would be more annoyed with a battery that runs out too quickly and also doesn't charge quickly either.
I'm leaning toward the S24 I just have a couple of reservations about it.

1) I had a Samsung phone before my X3 Pro and I hated how bloated it was. Especially Bixby which they seemed intent on forcing into everything even though it was useless. 

2) The camera issues. Are they resolved now? I saw that you could download an app to fix them, and that's fine, as long as they're actually fixed and not just 'slightly improved'.

Did you get the Ultra or just the regular S24? Do you have the Exynos or Snapdragon version>?
Pixel 9 Pro isn't offered, sadly.
Really not sure, the battery life looks crap and the processor performance makes me feel like it will be slow in 18 months to 2 years.

I've seen more than one person say that watch videos on the train on the way home and the phone gets super hot and discharges battery within two hours sot.
Worried about poor performance, battery life and it running hot all the time.

The S24 has camera issues which look like they can be fixed but everything else is better.
Wild assumption 😂

I'm into tech I'm just not massively into phones. I have a find X3 pro at the moment that's starting to show its age.
Not sure but it's significantly worse compared to other CPU (Snapdragon, Mediatek) from same gen.
P8p is shit. At least it was for me. As long as it was on WiFi it was fine but it was starting overheating as hell on mobile. I could get only about 1h30m sot. Battery couldn’t last even half a day with only 5h of Spotify (on Bluetooth headphones) and almost nothing else. My old iPhone 13 with the same usage still last almost 2 days
The phone does come loaded with a bunch of useless apps that I quickly deleted. I'm kinda new to Samsung as the last one I owned was an S5. I haven't used Bixby yet, I think you can use Googles Gemini instead. 

The camera is decent on the S24, I do find that Google is the master in the camera department. My Pixel 6 Pro took excellent photos. But I'm not a huge camera guy, so this doesn't bother me. 

I've got the regular S24 with the Snapdragon. I'm located in Canada. The phone has great performance and good battery life. I average 8 hours of SOT the last week. 

I don't think you could go wrong with either device. I'd stay away from iPhone, although they are good and people love them, I find them boring.
I can promise you the S24 is not better. My hubby has the S24 and I have the pixel 9. My battery lasts longer, it preforms better, and my phone has not ever run hot in the whole time I've had it. And you can't tinker with the S24 camera doesn't hold a candle to the pixel 9 camera! This was my first pixel phone after many many years of galaxy phones and I'm so glad I made the switch! I think now was the perfect time to make the switch!
Then do your research and don't ask strangers to pick from what is basically the whole price range and different operating system. There's too many variables and you'll get a thousand different answers.
When I was digging into it I found that the iPhone 16 only has a 60Hz screen, which I had to check and recheck because I found it so ridiculous. 

There's no way I could go from 120Hz on my PC, laptop and phone back to 60Hz on any device that I interact with.
This is already a pretty curated list? I said they're all affordable. It shouldn't be hard to say ""this is the best phone here for this and this reason.""

Just don't help if you don't want to and get some coffee.
Yeah, my wife has an iPhone 15 and it's super noticeable when scrolling on apps. My wife doesn't care though, she's always been an iPhone user. I don't even think she knows what refresh rate is lol
It is hard. Because they're all great and it comes down to preference.
You have both of the OS's, different sized phones, 3 brands across 2 generations and a phone that's half the price randomly thrown in there. How is that curated ?

Someone would have to do a whole phone industry analysis  over the past 2 years and compare it to a personal list of your preferences to be actually helpful.

And yea, i'm a bit angry right now... Not trying to take it out on you, but i'm not lying either.
I really don't understand your problem. Any question about which phone to buy is going to be choosing from several different models. 

Like, which is the best all around phone with good battery life from there? 

Again, if you don't want to help feel free not to comment.

Smartphones,Suggestions for a Reliable Compact Smartphone with a Great Camera (No Samsung),"Hi everyone! I’d like to buy a new smartphone since my Samsung S22 let me down due to the ""boot loop"" issue. The S22 was under warranty until December 2024, and I’m very disappointed with Samsung, so I’ve decided I’ll never buy a smartphone from this brand again.

Could you suggest a reliable smartphone that has ""compact"" dimensions like the S22 (e.g., 6.1**”**)? Since I also lost all my data, it’s very important for me to have the possibility to integrate everything with a cloud. I'd also like to have a very good camera. I’ve considered an iPhone (since I already have a MacBook) or the Google Pixel 9, but I’m open to any other suggestions! Thank you.

Smartphones,Help me pick cheaper alternatives for the Galaxy S24 Ultra,"# Summary 

Looking for alternative phones that perform almost as good as the Galaxy S24 Ultra 512gb, for a lot less of its retail price ($1500). Currently leaning on older flagships but will consider latest flagships if the price can be justified. I just want a phone that's practical and isn't a marketing gimmick tragedy.

My main considerations are the:

* Xiaomi 14T Pro 512gb | $700 
* Vivo x100 Pro 256gb | $660
* Google Pixel 9 Pro 256gb+ | $800-$1000
* Sony Xperia

# Criteria

After having the Galaxy S24 Ultra, my first flagship phone, for almost a whole year, I've learned a lot on what I want in a phone. I'm currently looking into a new one, and your insights and advice would be appreciated! Thanks!

I've done some research and used [GSMArena's Phone Finder tool](https://www.gsmarena.com/search.php3). I've got some options now, and I guess this post is about whether it's worth it or not. Also, I suck at researching and have trust issues with reviews, especially on YouTube, so here I am.

Here's my current criteria for a phone:

* **Price to value ratio & hardware longevity**
   * Learned the hard way that getting the latest flagships from Samsung/Apple at full price typically isn't worth it. 
   * I just want it to last me as long as it could and won't start to lag in just a few years.
   * Budget range would be around $600-$900 max, but if the price beyond could be justified, I'll consider it. 
   * *^(For reference, I got the S24 Ultra 512GB for $1500 last year with pre-order benefits, and I regret it big time.)* 
   * ^(Will consider second-hand/refurbished/renewed devices with warranty & 30 days return.)
* **Heat and Battery efficiency**
   * Battery life per charge that can last for at least 7 hours of screen-on time consistently.  *^(or just a whole day without having to charge on afternoon honestly)*
   * I don't want a phone that's being marketed with having a ""super powerful chip"" and ""super bright screen"" but in reality, heats up quick and throttles performance in just a few minutes of use when outdoors.
   * I play some games in high graphics & framerate, but I value stability and efficiency over performance. (At least 90fps)
* **Camera**
   * Has at least 24MP+, 55mm telephoto lens.
   * Able to record 4K 60fps on telephoto lens.
   * Good telephoto performance on mid-low light.
   * *Bigger sensor over phone aesthetics??*
   * *^((perhaps a camera that's also battery & heat efficient?))*
* **Storage**
   * At least 256 / 512gb, unless there are factors that can justify only 128GB.
   * I take a lot of pictures and videos when going outside. 
   * Also keep a lot of files on my phone. 
   * SD Card slot would be nice but not necessary.
* Others
   * Less marketing gimmicks, more practical features. 
      * I don't need super high megapixels, super high refresh rates, ""AI"" sh\*t.
   * Good aftersales is a myth in my country but let me know if there's a brand that has a good customer service reputation worldwide.

I realize this may be a lot of text, and tbh I just really want a phone that's ""worth it"".

# Other options:

* Google Pixel
   * *^(So far, I've been hearing good news about the latest Pixel 9. I'm also considering the older models, but I've heard something about their chips being inefficient or stuff.)*
   * *^(Might have issues with warranty and returns since I'll be bringing it to a country where it's not supported.)*
      * Pixel 9 Pro 256gb refurbished ($799 on Amazon US) (carrier unlocked)
      * Pixel 7 Pro 128gb ($430 on my local store)
* Vivo
   * *^(I've been seeing the x200 Pro being recommended by plenty of people online, but I'm not so sure.)* 
      * x200 Pro 512gb ($1200, will wait for when it drops)
      * x100 Pro (around $660)
      * other older models
* Xiaomi
   * I've been seeing the name a lot and on YouTube comparison videos. 
      * 14 Ultra
      * 14T Pro 512gb ($700 on official website)

OnePlus 13 is good check it out.
You have like the best phone now.
Why change? Keep it till it will degrade. 

I buy newest samsung note/ultra and im keeping till it becomes oldd.
Had note3(still works), note8(got stollen), note 10+ (lost), s24 ultra.

S24 ultra is so good, almost year with it and its a beast!
One plus 13
What is making you dislike the S24U? AFAIC, it ticks all your boxes. If you think Samsung's aftersales service is bad, the other 4 would be abysmal since they don't move nearly as many phones as Samsung.

Here's my take on your alternatives:  
Xiaomi 14T Pro - It's a rebranded Redmi pro, better to get the 14 or 15 instead. I personally do not trust Xiaomi's QC as I've got burnt twice already. Abysmal customer service.  
Vivo X100 Pro - At that price it's gonna be a Chinese rom I presume? Research on missing bands first. And it has a curved screen. Video is definitively the weakest amongst the four, but still photography should be the best.  
Google Pixel 9 Pro - Most compact of the bunch, if you value one-handed operations. The safest pick with the longest promised OS and security updates. Weakest SOC so don't think about gaming, let alone at 90fps.  
Sony Xperia (1 V? 1 VI? 5 V?) - Barebones OS skin and auto camera is the worst of the bunch. Has SD card and headphone jack though. Slimmer so one-handed operations is still possible.

Flagships are all very same-y nowadays, and the S24U is still one of the best phones you can get right now. You'll need to tell us what makes you dislike your S24U first before any meaningful recommendations can be made.
If you order the x200 pro from china you will get it for less and above all you will have superior performance to the s24 ultra
OnePlus 13 to discover
How much for Vivo x100 Pro 512GB or 1TB?
After a few days of researching, I think I've finally come up with a plan and narrowed my choices down to two phones: **Vivo x200 Pro** or **OnePlus 13**. I'll sell my S24U and buy the brand new Vivo/OnePlus since I can't risk buying without a warranty and a proper return policy. Also, here are the things I dislike about my S24U:

* I've come to hate the brand itself.
* It's overpriced and so I over-expected.
   * You'd think at that price point, Samsung would be all classy.
   * Made a dumb move in pre-ordering it at full price last year.
* The subpar small camera compared to other cheaper phones.
   * Recycled camera.
* All the ""AI"" marketing gimmick.
* The inefficient and power-hungry SD 8 Gen 3 chip, and
* the aluminum/stainless steel vapor chamber + plastic molding marketing gimmick that makes the overall heat management worse than its predecessor.
   * Being able to use the max brightness for only a few minutes outside is crazy.
* The fact that I went with Samsung because of their ""good reputation"" for long lasting phones and ""guaranteed"" quality but ended up with possibly the worst flagship of 2024 in terms of value.
* Something about the display frequency not being good for your eyes.
* The anti-reflecting screen that instantly goes away when you put a screen protector. 
   * Another gimmick, *although I was able to find a cheap anti-reflective protector somewhere.*
* Paid YouTube reviews.
   * Either paid, or bots praising the phone everywhere. Meanwhile, when you look at general smartphone forums, nobody ever mentions the S24 Ultra lol.
* Too many gimmicky half-baked features.
* Poor edge detection on Portrait mode.
* Video quality is terrible especially if you turn on video stabilization or action mode.
* The 5x telephoto zoom is [pure black at night](https://youtu.be/HPRy8UFZBJA?t=700) 💀
   * ""I swear to you, the Samsung lens is not covered."" had me laughing at the phone and myself
* [Can't even keep up with the 15PM or 9 Pro XL.](https://youtu.be/SucwT88p0oY?t=259)
* Games are locked at 60hz even if you set in-game graphics to 120fps.

It took me a whole year, but I've finally accepted the loss and now moving on. I will probably wait a few more months for the Vivo x200 Pro or OnePlus 13's prices to go down, but currently, both options are at $1000 and I'm not sure if I want to spend that much money on a phone again after the S24U.
You already have one of the best so your new phone will feel underwhelming. I suggest waiting a couple of years before upgrading.

I figured I would turn this post into a hate/rant post instead of recommendations if I listed the things I dislike about my S24U. Took me a few days but I finally put the list on a comment in this post.
Sounds like you just don't want a Samsung. Fair enough, I loathe Samsung too but I don't think they're as bad as you made it look. Don't know about the S24U as it's too big for my taste, but their baseline S models have been the most balanced compact phones for years now. 

Whichever the case, I'd suggest you adjust your expectations when you buy your next phone. Keep in mind that OP 13 recycled its cameras from OP 12 too, and Funtouch OS of the vivo is gonna be so barebones you'd think you had an Xperia (compared to OneUI). Every brand has its gimmicks, and every flagship can be considered overpriced when they newly launch. Both of your shortlisted phones have their fair share of quirks and flaws, just hang around the respective subs or watch some reviews by Chinese YouTubers. 

Just don't expect day and night difference when going from an S24U to any other flagship phone (and I'm not talking about just the cameras or performance, it's the entire phone package). And once you've switched, it's wiser to hang on to your new phone a little longer.",2025-01-21 06:06:19,1,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1i6c5q7/help_me_pick_cheaper_alternatives_for_the_galaxy/

Smartphones,Pixel 7a to...what?,"
While I was initially blown away by the camera on the 7a, over the years the terrible battery life(worse than the s20 it replaced) and constant severe heating has led me to to want out of this phone, and Googles tensor chips in general.

All of these are carrier options:

- S22 ultra CPO, $21/mo

- S23 ultra CPO, $28/mo( out of stock, but pops up once or twice a month)

- S23 ultra new, $33/mo with $800 down

- S24 new, $15/mo

- Pixel 9 pro new, $33/mo with $400 down

- Pixel 9 new, $24/mo

- Galaxy Z Flip6 new, $25/mo

  
How does one compare a phone that's a few years old to a newer one camera wise? The s24 is the logical choice here, but I REALLY do not want a downgrade in camera quality. Suggestions or advice welcome. Prefer a pick from the listed phones, or experience moving from Pixel camera to Samsung. Thank you!



Comments:
i live in europe so i dont know how it works there but cant you just buy a phone you like without being  X ammount $ per month ?   
S24 for 15$ seems a good deal  you save money but at the same time you have a phone that is a mini flagship
Did you check out the differences between Pixels and Samsungs as far as camera goes? We're not going to be able to tell you whether you'll prefer one over the other, that's something you have to find out.

Also, is going with carrier models the only way? Like, going with a main carrier over just buying a phone and getting an MVNO seems expensive, but I have no idea if that's just the way it has to be or how willing/able you might be to taking that route vs sticking with what you've got.
I'm on a Pixel 9 and really like it. Google was giving crazy trade-in values for other Pixels (got 540 for my Pixel 7 Pro), so you may want to check their online store.
Galaxy S24 x3 optical zoom triple camera. 8/256 GB 

We assume that the 8a is better than the 7a so in comparison with the S24 it can only improve both for photography and power, autonomy and heating control.
Yes you can absolutely! I just prefer to finance as A) less upfront cost and B) Sometimes it can work out to be cheaper, and C) I rarely keep a phone over two years anyway.
I have, but unfortunately (and obviously, I wasn't expecting any different) comparisons are done against current competition i.e s24 vs pixel 9. I've done the manual digging to compare 7a vs 8a, 8a vs 8 and 8 vs 9, 9 vs s24 already, but all of it seems subjective, and since I've never seen these places with my own eyes, its really hard to gauge what its SUPPOSED to look like. I'm probably overthinking this. Was just hoping for someone to share their experience moving between the two.

Absolutely not the only way! Just a preference. The s24 for instance is only $360 this way, whereas an open box unit is still around $680 (this is CAD, forgot to mention). Same as the CPO ultras, they work out to 800-900 cheaper than buying outright. No other carriers have plans this cheap so if I want to keep my $38/mo plan, I do have to stick with this specific carrier though.
That would've been good so I immediately went to check, and its $170 lol it's $280 on ebay so not crazy bad, but still $1300 upfront cost vs $550(ish) on contract.
Ohhh being in Canada changes things somewhat. Here in the US, usually the best ""deals"" involve being signed up for like, a $65+ per month plan which helps subsidize the cost of the phone.
Gotcha. I caught mine on Black Friday so after the sale price and trade in it came out to $209.
Ahh I see. Here it's a ""plan cost"" and a ""phone cost"". For reference my 7a was $25 a month,plus the $39/mo ""plan cost"" (unlimited everything, 50gb data) with a $200 ""discount"" that decreased monthly over 24 months, the discount amount varies by the phone. The s24's discount is $600. If you try to pay them off early, you owe the remainder of the ""discount"" and your balance cost. Hopefully that makes sense. 

So if I bought it tomorrow, but decided I wanted out of the contract the next day, I would owe the contract balance ($15x24months=$360+$600 discount=$960) vs keeping it the two years, the total cost is $360. This is why I prefer contracts here, sometimes they make more sense, we also RARELY get deals outside of carriers unless amazon or someone big is trying to clear stock. Were run by 3 major companies, that own other smaller ""tier 2"" companies that offer better deals for worse service (no tech support etc). I'm with one of the tier 2 companies.

Sorry for the rant, hopefully that clears it up!
WOW. I'm guessing you're in the USA then? We don't typically get deals up here (Canada) outside of carriers. I should've specified what country sorry.

I know this question was probably asked around a billion times, but hopefully you guys can help.

In terms of price I can find both at around 900€ in Italy for the 128gb and 256gb.

Let me help. If photography is a top priority along with spam call screening , get a Pixel.  If you play heavy games like Genshin Impact all day, get the ultra. If it's anything else, either one is fine. I would go try each one in the store and see which you like. I love my Pixel 9 pro XL but camera is number 1 for me and I can't stand the square ultra. It's ugly.  You should also consider the new OnePlus 13 if gaming or battery life is your thing. That thing looks smokin but skimps a bit on photos.
Wait 1mth and get s25.

Smartphones,Google Pixel 9 Pro XL vs iPhone 16 Pro Max,"Considering buying a new phone, I currently have the Google Pixel 7 Pro, I didn't have an iPhone since maybe 5 or 6. Currently my Google Pixel 7 Pro Is dying so fast even though the application I installed a month ago says the battery health is at 92% and at random times I see a line going down the screen and I'm really unsure what it is but it bothers me.

I never had an iphone in such a long time that I'm not really sure where things currently are, I see the iPhone is like WAY faster in terms of processing power than the Google Pixel 9Pro xl and even the battery life is way more efficient.

The iPhone is from what I see around 1300-1400 euros while if I traded in my google p7p they offer a 345 euro trade in bringing the phone down to 850 and also offering 250 euro free google pixel buds pro 2 for free. They offered a smart watch the last time I got my P7P sad it isn't the same.

Which would you go for? Some insight is I like using an ad blocking browser to read manhwa, I don't really game sometimes I do but never consistently, I use my phone a lot for photos and videos.

as an iPhone user that has been with Apple since 2017 i would suggest you go for the Pixel. Android is nowadays just as good as iOS, but with more features.

I would say it depends on how long you plan to keep it. If you upgrade every 1-2 years get the pixel. If you want to keep it longer 3-5 years go with the iPhone.
But isn't the iphone like 60% faster and better battery ?
Wouldnt it be the other way as iphone retains more value?
No
Used to be , that’s why I switched to iOS ,  but not anymore
Yea it is
I see this from a youtuber that did tests and the iphone lasted 5 hours more [https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/988755016531714048/1328447937617068133/image.png?ex=678765cd&is=6786144d&hm=531f484f613f2a0286165241f9d1aeda7bf572ff2d30d676d2a85088b654a6b7&=&format=webp&quality=lossless](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/988755016531714048/1328447937617068133/image.png?ex=678765cd&is=6786144d&hm=531f484f613f2a0286165241f9d1aeda7bf572ff2d30d676d2a85088b654a6b7&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)

Smartphones,Google Pixel 9 Pro XL vs Oneplus 13,"Some time ago I had a small adventure with an unsuccessful Pixel purchase (let's say the store screwed up).

I set my sights on the Oneplus 13 which I managed to get at a good price + a watch and some other gadgets.



In the meantime, the store that screwed up contacted me and as an apology, offered me the Pixel 9 Pro with a big discount.



Right now, the price of both devices would cost me the same (I'm leaving out OnePlus gadgets).

And here comes the question - which one to choose.



Both have pros and cons.

Better battery, faster charging, better components in Oneplus, longer support, better movies (?), simple screen in Pixel 9 Pro XL.



At times I wanted to flip a coin and choose - but maybe you can help me.

Which one would you choose and why?

Comments:
oneplus 13 will age better. In a couple years the pixel will slow downnn. Remember doesn't matter if you are gaming or not, the fact is that you are getting a processor on par with a snapdragon 8 gen 1. that is still unacceptable. the oneplus will feel snappy for years to come. While both have great cameras, it's up to you if you like the hassleblad tuning or not. Search up camera tests as I can't speak from personal experience. Plus you get free high end earbuds and watchs plus a 150 dollar any phone any condition trade in discount plus a free upgraded to the 512gb model. Seems like a win for the oneplus 13
Not sure what you mean by better components, they are probably about the same. I have a P9PXL and love it. The OnePlus 13 looks amazing too. Don't think you can go wrong but here is my take
OnePlus 13 if battery and gaming is most important
Pixel if Photo quality, software support, and AI is important.  
Gemini is really useful. Probably use it 10 times a day for different things. 
Hope that helps.  I get the appeal of the OnePlus 13
I honestly think you'll get better reliability over time with OnePlus 13.
OP13 offers 5 years of software updates.

Pixel offers 7 years.

Both have good cameras. 

OP13 has better SoC, better battery (6000 vs 5060 on Pixel)



Bottom Line: OP13 has better hardware, and Pixel has some better software. I think you'd be happy with either. Depends on how much you need that battery size.
The Oneplus 13 has addressed PWM.  Not to be sniffed at IMO.

On the flip side I have the 9 Pro XL and I would miss the camera features (add me is actually pretty cool) and other stuff like now playing etc. 

YMMV

Edit, looks like no APTX- Adaptive on the OnePlus 13 🤦🏻‍♂️
What matters to you more? Camera or performance? That should tell you which one to buy. If it was me, if OnePlus gives the watch or the new buds for free, I'm taking the OnePlus, else I'll buy pixel
I have the p9pXL and the fold 9 pro. I just ordered the OnePlus 13 and traded in the fold. From all the reviews I've seen, the camera is not far off. It doesn't look like the pixel is miles ahead. I think the biggest thing pixel has is software updates. You will get the latest android first.
My Pixel 9 Pro XL I feel has average battery life. It is however the best battery life ever seen on a pixel. 

Can it compete with the OnePlus 13? That's a no in pretty much every single category. I was choosing between the OnePlus 12 and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and that was a tough decision. With the 13 out I feel like it's mostly a no brainer. 

With that being said, if you want a no bullshit phone that just works, get the Pixel. I've owned several pixels over the years and been disappointed with each, shortly upgrading to an equivalent Samsung or OnePlus at the time. 

This is the first Pixel I've ever owned where I don't find myself wanting to replace it. It feels quality, the haptic motor is good, it's responsive, clean, uncluttered, and just simply works. I love the design, not a big fan of iOS and Apple but I do love the look of their phones. The current Pixel looks like an iPhone, and I'm more than okay with that especially the flat screen. 

The OnePlus 13 looks like a hybrid screen leaning towards flat. Kind of like the OnePlus 8t. For me that's a huge upgrade from the OnePlus 12. One of my favourite phones ever was the Samsung S21 Ultra, which I had before the P9PXL so I was used to curved edges but still bothered me enough to not pick the OnePlus 12. 

Either way OnePlus beats Google in CPU performance, GPU performance, screen brightness, charging speed, battery life etc. Not sure about camera but I haven't been particularly impressed with the Pixels camera so if the OP13 is worse that would suck. 

But this phone just freaking works. Really cool features and I love the stock android experience. OnePlus especially being Chinese has slower updates, ignored problems and software problems. Not that Google is perfect, but I'd say they have a slight edge here and that's enough for me to stick with the Pixel. 

If it breaks though, I'm definitely going OP13 instead of buying another pixel, just to try it. Haven't had an OP phone since the 7 pro, and that was by far my favourite phone ever. Even though I hated the curved edges lol
One plus 13 is better than pixel In everything 

Look camera can be debated 
Software is personal choice 

But other than that one plus is leagues ahead
OnePlus
OnePlus has better benchmark results and is also more reliable in my experience.
Have you researched x200 pro to take it into consideration?
Are you an ""update"" junky? Remember (I know from vast experience) that OnePlus updates their phones every-other-month = 6 times per year. I did not mind their methods. Pixels get updates at least once per month or more! So.....
Oneplus has more powerful components, a better processor, better benchmark results.
In the end, it fell on Oneplus. The reason is quite... odd. It was all about promotion (Or rather, the lack of it in the Pixel)
Well, that's the problem... 
The battery is important - because in the current mi 10 Pro I have to charge it 2 - 3 times I already have something. On the other hand, the camera - I'm a photographer by education, I've been running with a full-frame DSLR for 20 years and quality matters.
I've also been a gamer for almost 40 years, but I don't use the phone for gaming - I prefer the handheld although I like the interesting look (I liked the Asus rogphone)
so little and so much at the same time

But if that's the only real advantage, then there's probably a bit more to say in favor of Oneplus (from battery and charging time to overall performance - ending with the extras you get when you buy it).
Yes of course. Unfortunately, it is not available in our country.
I don't know. In Xiaomi I had very few updates, and the company stopped updating my model a little over 2 years after the release (it's sad that their most powerful flagship was killed so quickly). 

Today I got Oneplus.
Why this one? Fate decided so when strange actions came out of the Google Pixel (they had promotions to buy back the old device and somehow it turned out so strange).
Just the main processor. Not the rest of the thousands of components. Unless you are heavy gaming it really doesn’t matter
Now that it's been 20 days,  what's your thoughts on the Oneplus 13?
If battery is your first priority, both phones should last a day in normal usage but OnePlus can last longer due to higher capacity and a more efficient chipset
The fold I want to really like but it's annoying. Software is way behind Samsung's foldables. Too many apps not optimized. Then they pushed all the latest updates and to get split screen you have to rotate the fucking phone. To me that defeats the whole purpose of the big display inside. OnePlus offered good trade in and it's been long time since I tried one. Was a great deal with all the extras. Everything I've seen online the cameras pretty good.
And???? I'm typing from it and is not available here either. Go to tradingshenzhen
This is cap, the Pixel has a much older and slower UFS 3.0 storage which was only found in flagships released before Q4 of 2023!!!! This sh\*t came out Q4 of 2024!!!! Like I wanna root for Google simply for the exterior hardware and the cameras but WTF?!! Gaming my ass, this phone will age so poorly compared to every other flagship of its time!
I don't have much of a comparison with other current-generation phones 
What can I say in comparison with the mi 10 Pro - then for sure Oneplus is like a rocket. 
Everything runs faster, even basic functions seem to run faster and smoother.

The battery lasts a very long time. 
2 days of normal use calmly, with mobile data and bt on all the time.

I didn't test the camera in any specific way, just a few photos.
I won't say a bad word, but I don't have a comparison here. 
The photos are detailed, sharp - which is everything I need to be happy 

What annoys me a bit is the system or rather the overlay
I would like to say scroll through the applications that I have in the folders up and down, and I can only right, left (detail, but still irritating). There was something else, but I don't remember I would like to say scroll through the applications that I have in the folders up and down, and I can only right, left (detail, but still irritating). There was something else, but I don't remember anymore 🤣
Do you have the issue with OP killing apps like streaming and YouTube aggressively? I just now read about it and it seems so weird! 
Then it turns out that some band is not in the phone that we have, or the software is not completely polished... I don't want to play with it. I'm sticking with these two.
No
The pro version has all bands and the software is perfectly fine, I like origin os better than one ui.

If you want to settle for less and not research is your choice, good luck",2025-01-13 18:10:03,9,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1i0kbz7/google_pixel_9_pro_xl_vs_oneplus_13/

Smartphones,What next after a Galaxy S20 FE? ,"Hi everyone, I hope you're all doing well.

Currently, I'm using a Samsung S20 FE, which I bought as soon as it was released, so it's been with me for quite some time. Since I don’t see the need to change phones every year, I’ve stuck with it. But now, I need a new one. Let me say this: I haven’t enjoyed a phone this much since my Nexus 7 — kudos to Samsung for that!

Here are my reasons for needing a new phone now:

* The battery isn’t what it used to be.
* The phone has become painfully slow, probably due to software trying to conserve the aging battery.
* It stopped receiving major updates after Android 13. Now that I need to use passkeys, which require at least Android 14, it's becoming a problem.
* The backplate keeps falling off because the glue has lost its hold. 😅
* When using GPS apps, it points slightly off, which is frustrating - probably an issue with the compass.
* The phone overheats a lot—likely another reason the glue is no longer effective.

So, here’s the challenge. Right now, my options are:

* **Google Pixel 9 Pro XL**: Looks amazing, and it’d be nice to have access to features like ONE UI 7.
* **Samsung S24+**: A cheaper option, but I’m in Portugal, so no Snapdragon version for us.
* **Galaxy Event**: It’s just around the corner, but I need a phone *now*—remember the backplate situation.

Can anyone help me make a better decision? I hate buying new stuff because I end up overthinking it, which makes me anxious. 😅

Comments:
Commenting to boost the post as i am considering a s24 right now but i have no clue.
Pixel 9 pro XL IS amazing. Have had mine 4 months and an still in love.  Great phone. Great photos and runs like a champ
To save money, the Galaxy S24 FE (?)
Can I know what was your previous phone?
iPhone 13.
I grabbed the S24 FE from Cricket back in November and honestly have no complaints. Great upgrade from any of the other FE phone imo.

Got the phone for $99 + sales tax w/ the $60 plan. So I walked out with the phone ($649 unlocked from Samsung) for around $210ish and was all set. Unlock policy is activation on Cricket network for 6 months. Idk, I'd say it's a good deal if ATT/Cricket have good service in your area.

I don't know if the sale is still ongoing or not though, but they usually slash prices significantly at the prepaid carriers for a variety of phones.

Sidenote:

I know that Exynos got a bad rep over the years, but the 2400e actually does pretty decent for me if not very good most times.

So if you're worried about the Exynos processor inside, it's not horrendously unstable like ones of the past, at least my experience says so.",2025-01-13 12:55:55,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1i0db6o/what_next_after_a_galaxy_s20_fe/
Smartphones,"Samsung S24 FE, Google Pixel 9, or Samsung S24","Hi everyone!

I’m looking to upgrade my phone and I'm torn between three options and would love to get your thoughts:

* **Samsung Galaxy S24 FE** for €470
* **Google Pixel 9** for €480 
* **Samsung Galaxy S24 (Exynos)** for €570

I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, which I really liked, but unfortunately, I dropped it in water, and it got damaged. So now I’m considering my options for a new phone. I’ve been happy with the Samsung experience, but I’m also thinking about trying a Google Pixel to experience the pure Android interface and the advantages of its camera.

I don’t play games on my phone, so the processor isn’t a huge concern for me. From what I understand, the Samsung S24 is generally considered better overall (except for the camera, where the Pixel shines), but I’m not really sure in which aspects this shows in practice.

One thing I’ve never used on my S20 FE is Dex mode, and I don’t fully understand the benefit of using it that way. It seems easier to just use my computer when I need something with a bigger screen or more productivity-based.

Given my needs and what I’ve experienced so far, which of these three phones would you recommend the most? I’d really appreciate any advice!

If you don't video record for long streches it's a fine device. It's sad they didn't add the vapor chamber in the base pixel and only the pro
You are fine. My wife has a pixel 8 and has recorded 3 minute videos with no significant heating and they are beautiful.  I have done 5 minutes and zero issues (9.pro XL) . If you are not playing Genshin impact at 120 Hz there are no issues.  I recommend spring for the pro for the telephoto lens if you can afford it or get a Pixel 8 pro refurb on Amazon for like $350.  
Stop believing YouTubers who test the phone for a day and pass along the baloney they hear from other influencers. You won't be sorry with a Pixel 8 pro or a 9 or 9 pro. All awesome phones with the best cameras

The only thing that's stopped me from pulling the trigger on both is the tensor chip in the pixel 9, it's seriously underpowered when it comes to graphics. But I think the old iphone chip should do just fine?

Oneplus 13. I just ordered one and I have been using a Huawei P30 for years.

Pixel battery is apparently shit.
check out the one plus service in your area because the one plus service and customer support in my area is horrible
way better battery, processor and its not a google phone
I love my Pixel 9 XL and Gemini is the best but the videos I have seen of the one plus 13 are awesome. It’s a tough choice. The S25 is all hype. I agree choose one of these. Gemini might sway me but that big battery and the speed and that blue suede back.  Tough one
One plus only gives you three years of updates, Pixel is giving 7 years I think which is important if you want to keep the phone a long time
Pixel 9 pro xl user here. Everything great but not battery ! Only get 6h of SOT. Looking forward to switch to oppo and oneplus.
I just dont like that big camera module circle on the back of the phone.
Oneplus 13 comes with Snapdragon Elite, its hard to beat.
OnePlus 13. Better than the Pixel in battery and performance.
I would wait for the launch of the s25. I have a pixel 9 pro and better than it seems. But ultimatly recommend waiting for the s25 line and the decide.
OnePlus 13. Everything else is very similar, except battery and cpu. Cpu is around double the speed. Battery charges 3x faster and lasts longer.
Pixel no good. Not for the price
Considering your comment about gaming, I would go with the oneplus 13, It will both be faster than google and on par with samsung's S25U(its the same damn chip people) as for the 4/5 years that you will keep it, it almost perfectly lines up with the 13's support 4 years of OS updates and 6 years of security updates. The battery on the 13 will also well exceed both google and samsung(as well as the majority of consumer phones), Oxygen OS is also less bloated than OneUI and smoother than the pixel. BTW you still get Gemini but its lacking in function compared to the ol' google assistant. 

(the pixel will thermal throttle after a little bit with gaming)
Honestly by reading your text I'd maybe even recommend the Pixel 9 pro because of longer support regarding updates etc. I never had a pixel phone though so I can't really comment much on it, but I feel like this would be the safest take.

Nevertheless, I still ordered the OnePlus 13 because I'm a OnePlus fanboy and I like many of the features (oxygen OS, aqua touch, battery and so on). If fast charging isn't that important to you, maybe even wait for the next Pixel? And maybe get a OnePlus 12, 12R or even 13R while waiting on the Pixel if you can afford that (I couldn't lol)
Oneplus 13 with 16GB of ram and 512GB storage, SD 8 Elite, 6000mha battery, Silcon / Carbon battery, Ceramic Glass, 100watt charging, IP69, UFS 4.0, Higher res screen, brighter screen, and $300 less than the Pixel 9 Pro XL.
The Tensor is not a good CPU.

No brainer.
OnePlus 13 pixel no good
I almost use it for everything from work to social, banking, gaming
I was affascinated for the pure google experience and the Gemini implementation.but oneplus13 has more power and battery.
++ 1 , went from Huawei mate 20 pro to P8Pro.
I'm also considering One plus as my next buy.
My Mate 20 pro still works great after replacing the battery. 
Apparently it seems Google apps on Google phone drains the most battery & network sips battery like juice.
4 years software and 6 years of security actually.
Reall? I have the pro no xl and the battery than my previous iphone 15 pro max that I sold to buy the pixel. My only complaint about the battery is the charging speed, my old onellus 3 would charge faster.
13r? It's smaller
My recommendation wait and get the S25 ultra

Smartphones,"Pixel 9, Galaxy S23 FE, or iPhone 13","Those are the three phones offered by my job. I have a personal iPhone 13 Pro. 

I don't really have any specific needs. It'll be a three year contract so I can ask for another phone in three years. 

I'm leaning Pixel to see what it's like. And the many years of updates. An Android would be interesting to get to learn. The iPhone 13 would be familiar, the base model version of my personal phone, so it would be the lazy/easy choice. But feels crazy to get a 3.5 year old phone vs a half year old phone. 

Any thoughts?

Comments:
I just dumped an iPhone 13 for a Pixel 9 pro.  Trust me, go with the Pixel, you will be amazed how much better it is than your iPhone especially in 3 areas, call quality, spam call filtering, and photos. Also, it is much more customizable. My wife has a Pixel 8 and loves hers too.
The pixel offered isn’t a pro, but the videos I’ve watched on it seem like it barely matters, that the base pixel 9 is great and mainly missing the telephoto lens. 

I’ll still be keeping my iPhone for personal, but would be nice to see the advancements in Android since my old Galaxy Note 2. 
She has the normal 8 and it is great. The base Pixel 9 is an excellent phone. You are basically comparing a new Pixel phone with a 4 year old iPhone. The new iPhone 16 is not as good from what I can tell than the Pixel 9. I looked at them and they were not any different than the 13 I was getting rid of.
I just got the pixel 9 today. Gonna play around. For starters it feels a lot like my iPhone. Seems intuitive to use. 
Have fun.  Lots of good videos on how to set it up.  Watch them on YouTube. You need to turn up the refresh rate for sure and if I remember you need to go into developer mode to do that.  Be sure to turn on clear calling and call screening for sure.",2025-01-08 06:02:01,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1hwd0v3/pixel_9_galaxy_s23_fe_or_iphone_13/

Smartphones,New smartphone,"
Hey Reddit,

After being a loyal iOS user for 13 years, I’m finally considering switching back to Android. It’s been a long time since I used Android, so I’m not sure what to expect in terms of performance, user experience, and longevity.

Currently, I’m torn between the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and the OnePlus 13. My top priorities are:
- Battery life: I need a phone that can last a full day of heavy use without constant recharging.
- Performance over time: One thing I appreciated about iOS was the consistency. My concern is whether Android phones still have the issue of slowing down after a year or two. Are these two models good at maintaining performance?
Does one stand out in terms of build quality or performance (daily use only no gaming, rendering etc.). Or is still best sticking to apple and choosing 16 pro over this two?

Comments:
I own an android ( pixel ) as my personal phone and an iPhone for work and personally I like android more. AI on Androids is worlds better than apple intelligence. Also just can't really justify apples prices anymore. As for slowing down over a year or two. Doesn't happen anymore. Hasn't happened for me in years. Android has really stepped up their game in the last 13 years. I don't think you'd be disappointed. As for pixel vs OnePlus. I don't think you can go wrong either way. Both have good batterys. I know the OnePlus 12 had a killer battery and crazy screen on time so I'm sure the 13 is the same if not better. But like I said I don't think you could go wrong either one. Its really personal preference on this on which you like more because both are great phones.",2025-01-04 23:46:03,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1htryjo/new_smartphone/

Smartphones,Pixel 9 Pro in EU - worth the € ?,"Hi everyone, this is a question aimed at people in the EU, as from reading people's opinions in this and other subs, the US is a total different world for deals on phones in general.

At the moment, the country where I live has an offer for a free Fitbit Versa 4 if I purchase a Pixel 9 Pro. I am contemplating buying the 256GB one, and I am able to use a gift voucher, which will bring the price down to 800€ total. Does this seem a good opportunity in EU standards? I reckon we should not expect any major price drops in the coming months and I really need to change my phone as I'm currently using a very old Samsung A50 which is end of life. Personally, I want a phone smaller than 6.4' with a robust camera and there aren't many options out there other than P9P.

Thanks in advance!

Comments:
As a pixel 7 pro user I can say it will perform very well for that pricepoint (I've never had any performance problems with this and it's 2 more years of upgrades so it must be good), however, as much as you want a good camera, do you need the 5x camera? If you don't then the standard pixel 9 will also be perfectly good for your needs so may save you some money, although I wouldn't know if it would be worth the saving if you can't get a deal like the free Fitbit with it.
Yes for the gift and the price in the 256 GB version. imo
Great price and the pixel 9 pro is a good device. Especially for that price.
Good price for one of the top android phones out there.
Have you handled the 9 Pro? It's a brick and It's so thick it looks like an iPhone from 15 years ago.

Great phone performance wise though and stellar camera.
Thank you for your insight! The free Fitbit is an offer for the Pro only. The standard pixel 9 would be around 600€ in this case
Just out of curiosity, what does the 5x camera do?
Thanks for your point of view!
It depends on how much you need the Fitbit. The difference between the 9 and the 9 Pro, is quite minimal, I have the 9 myself and I'm very content. I got it in combination with a sim deal for only €208! I think if you can still apply the coupon on the normal 9 and it's also the 256GB version, go for the normal 9. Otherwise, if 600 is for 128, just get the Fitbit and the 9 Pro.
It's a camera with a longer lens to give you 5x native 'zoom' so you can get a bit more reach without having to digitally crop your image like you would zooming in on a normal 1x camera. I just did a quick test on mine, it gives you a 4000x 3000 resolution image, but if you were to take an image on your 1x camera and crop to the same size, you'd only be left with about a 1000x700 resolution image.
That's a great deal you got! Thanks for your insight, I will have to make a decision soon enough as the fitbit deal will end in a couple of days so that's quite helpful
Thanks a lot for the info.",2025-01-03 16:07:10,3,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1hspuzr/pixel_9_pro_in_eu_worth_the/
Gadgets,Another Pixel 9 Pro camera bar fault makes us worried about Google's quality control,"

Comments:
Embarrassing af. With how expensive they make these shit boxes… one would think of some quality control…
Every year I consider a new Pixel.  And after Google just had to cough up a new battery for my Pixel 4A, articles like these remind me that I'm better off making this phone last.
90 day warranty? Sounds illegal
Wow what a shit article . 

TL;DR Some dude on reddit said "" his camera is moving away from the body""
I've had 4 different pixels and they have all had hardware failure. If you ever weren't worried about Google's quality control, you weren't paying attention.
I have an 8 pro and my screen just randomly ate shit one day after having it for 11 months. I will never buy another pixel.
[removed]
With the exception of the OG Pixel and Pixel 2 I’m pretty sure every other pixel had quality control issues. Just hand over the hardware to Samsung and provide a clean Pixel UI
Has any pixel been good? I switched after the 4,5,7, and 8.  Problems with all of them.  My iPhone 14  and 16 Pro just work.  Only complaint now is the governments iMessage.
I've had to have my pixel 8 screen repaired three times in the past two months. All seemingly because of a defect. I loved my 3XL but the 8 has been giving me problems. Of course I bought my wife one shortly before my phone started having issues
This is why I just went with Motorola. Solid build quality, not nearly as expensive as a bloatware filled Samsung that barely performs better in real world usage either. 

Which is disappointing. I loved my OG Pixel XL.
[deleted]
The pixel pro is on the lower end of premium phones. You get what you pay for. I have a 9 pro but only because they offered me $550 for my 7 pro on a trade in. On top of the $150 sale they already had on the 9pro. So I got my new phone for about $300. I'm playing the hardware lottery, sure. But I pay insurance on the phone for a reason and I'm not coughing up half a mortgage for an iPhone.
LOL people are just now realizing Google's hardware is trash??
Google’s quality control has been shit forever.
The Quality Control department was probably laid off due to not being a revenue generating team. This is 2025 America where we prioritize stock buybacks over quality products.
Honestly my pixel 9 has been a pain in the ass. Didn't have any issues with my 7 but I'm not sure I'll be getting another after this one.
I loved my Pixel 4a! Hold on to it as long as you can. 
It is. In the civilized part of the world at least
Websites list 2 years here in the Netherlands.
Huch? Even in EU, which usually is really consumer friendly, Warranty is completly optional.
Weird. I have a pixel 7 and it's probably the best phone I've ever owned.
I'm on my 5th iteration (all the odd numbers) and haven't had any real issues, knock wood
Dude you had 4 , I think you re projecting.
I also have an 8 Pro and have had nonstop stuttering/UI microfreezes since 1 month into ownership. All workarounds and ""fixes"" were not successful. Only other one is, you guessed it, a new phone.

3a was great. 5 was good. Satisfied with my current 7.

Had no problems with any of them. Just the fingerprint scanner on the 7 isn't as good as the prior versions.
My 2 was good, 3 shit the bed and my 6 died after Android 15 update.  My 8 is a couple of weeks old.  Could be my last Pixel.
Parts coming off due to using the phone is exactly the concern
You are just mad because the ceo worked 327 times harder than you and was paid as such.
Agreed. I have consistently had pixel phones since the pixel 1. I'm sick of feeling like buying a pixel I keep needing to name compromises on either hardware or software. My Bluetooth is bugged, and consistently crashes audio connections. Dealing with warranty on this has been, not encouraging, to say the least.
My Pixel 6 is still a disaster. You're lucky you went to the 7.
The article states 90 days, that is what I'm referring too
My pixel 7 had the whole screen peeling off the rest of the phone. It started doing that after about 3 months, but by the time it was two years old, it was hanging on by a thread. 

Other than that, I really liked the phone.
I also had all the odd numbers (except 3). 

1: the microphone stopped working. This was a widespread issue that plagued the pixel 1s.

5: Volume buttons stopped working. Also, the fingerprint scanner never really worked. It worked maybe 60% of the time? It was bad.

7: my screen peeled off the rest of the phone. 

So far so good with my 9. I haven't had it for very long, though.
Yeah, from what I found, Goggle actually makes the highest rated phones on a number of factors.




The person above you having 4 bad phones out of the 40 million sold is fine for them making a buying decision but isn't exactly a robust study of Google's QA. The article is also talking about 2 phones out of how ever many are sold is just click bait at this point




https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/compare/sim_only_deals/most-reliable-mobiles
The 7 broke me.  Android auto would not stay connected and had to be reset over and over.  That was the fin straw.  I had hoped the 8 would fix that but it was identical and out the window Pixel went .

Gadgets,Broke your Pixel 9 Pro Fold's inner screen? You can buy an S24 Ultra for the price of repair | Listed spare parts on iFixit highlight just how expensive damaging the Pixel 9 Pro Fold could be for you.,"

Comments:
My brand new zflip 4's screen ceased function after less than a year of GENTLE use. Folding screens need more development before you try to stick consumers with faulty hardware.
Foldable phones aren't for everyone. They're outrageously expensive, heavy, and fragile. But if you use your phone as a small tablet more than as a phone, and you have the means, they're glorious. You just have to be realistic about what you're getting.
I’m shocked people are still buying these scamphones (foldable category as a whole) utter deserters waiting to happen.
Kind of surprised they caught on if they didn't fix the biggest issue people had about them.
Folding screens are a dumb idea, and always have been. Why would I want my phone to be twice as thick, just so I can open it up to something not quite as useful as a tablet?
Source?
They're incredible. Never going back to a slab
I love mine. Despite having a few issues with it over the years I'll only be looking at folding phones to replace it when it finally croaks. I can't imagine going back.
Click on the link, read the article.
username checks out
Do you ask for a source when someone hands you a book to read? FFS.
Had one and they suck hard, not only are apps not built for them. They have useless exterior screens. Phone protectors are a joke. The inner screen is way to fragile and in some cases (Samsung I had the fold2 ) they don’t even have the best hardware despite the costs.

Yes they are fragile but they have much better screens for reading than shitty 20:9 ratio on all other phones.

Gadgets,Pixel 9 Pro reportedly costs Google around 400 USD in materials,"

Comments:
Sounds like a high price, tbh, I mean that’s only materials it needs software, transportation to the customer, marketing etc etc do they even make profit on it?
If I’m not mistaken, that’s in the same ballpark as iPhones. I think iPhones cost 440$ to produce?
Remember when Pixels were budget flagship phones?
So 999$ in retail is not that much If you add labor and margin.
Feels nice, probably the best phone Google has ever made. Slippery as a toad and the bezels are a tad fat compared to the new iPhones but those are minor grievances. Think I would still take that over a large island in the screen.
Materials or parts?
And that’s just the materials. Now add all the overhead costs.
That's actually not bad at all
Got mine out the door for $500. Very happy with it

Edit: before people ask, it was on sale through my carrier Spectrum for $600 and they took my old phone for $100 more.
pixel has 16%+ of phone market in US and keeps growing
Ah,  so it'll be around $1400.99
Google makes money on data. You are the product, even when you’re buying the product. Google has all of your location data, app data, website data and is using it to advertise through their ad platforms. Most of the ads you see online are placed through Google Ad networks out side of social websites.
Interesting, that seems pretty reasonable for the materials! The real question will be how much they price it at and how it competes with the iPhone
Well, are we talking materials, or parts?  Because let's face it the actual phone, the radios, the memory, the speakers, etc.  are all manufactured and then integrated.  I believe the number you are looking at is for parts. Each of those companies is making their own profit on the part itself. 

Google (or whatever part of the Alphabet makes Pixels) could Massively reduce that by vertically integrating, but that makes them much less flexible. And if you bring out a new model a couple times a year, that is important.
I'm a little surprised that it's that high. I must admit I've never researched it, I just assumed most phones had a bigger overall margin in between materials costs and sales cost. There's still advertising/marketing, you've said materials do not inclusive of manufacturing? Then distribution, etc etc..

Yeh just a little surprised. Huh. 

Not a good surprise or a bad surprise per se, just huh surprise.
And I paid $300 for my Pixel 9 after trading my Pixel 7 in
This just in! Thing costs less money to make than consumers pay to buy it! More at 11!
Do you really think that you're only paying for the materials, when you are buying a phone, that advanced?
Gotta pay those execs the big bucks too
Do they own their own supply chain? Wouldn't be surprised if it actually costs $100 in materials but they charge themselves a bunch through shell corporations in order to reduce their taxable profit margin
Can’t we pay in cash?
Just googled and compared a few sources, an iPhone 16 Pro appears to cost around the same to a little more. I find $485
By taking a cut of any money you spend on apps
As someone who works in research and development, you have no idea how much research and development costs 🤣
People that buy Google cloud storage because they can't stand to delete 400 pictures from July 4th fireworks from 8 years ago. 

These phones primarily drive Google cloud services and Google search.
The profit is in the data they collect on you - location, website patterns, app usage.
Apple makes sure to get 40% profit margin, so I’m sure they make plenty of money.
Definitely a high price for basically spyware
Thank God for slave labor in China and other countries, none of us could afford this shit otherwise. They'd have to make them last a little longer and let us repair them etc. Not that we can upend anything, I just think this should be in the conversation
It seems a bit surprising. Not a good surprise , or bad surprise, just a 'huh' surprise.
Read the article, literally the first line/paragraph it talks about how this is a reduction in cost. It’s 11% cheaper than the Pixel 8 Pro.
They make more off of selling information.
Im actually surprised, as I expected Apple's economy of scale to get them further here. In some areas iPhones might use slightly fancier components, but still.
By golly I do. pixel 7 Pro was the last budget flagship. After that it cost as much as a Smasnug
That didn't sale. The 9 Pro and Pro XL are selling, apparently very well. Interestingly, I saw some data that they are pulling more people from Apple than other Android platforms (other than current Pixel Owners, who generally tend to stick with Pixels).

Part of the issue is the optics. You sell a cheaper phone, people will believe it's a cheaper product. Pixel never was. Heck even the basic non-pro Pixels have nearly the same hardware under the hood as the top end models. Heck even the Pixel A series had basically the same hardware as the mainline phones. Now they have a price and design that matches the other flagships, and boom. They got sales. And knowing Pixel Owner retention, they are likely to make lots of loyal pixel customers.

*I am a bit biased. I'm typing this on my Pixel 7 (not Pro) that is being replaced with a Pro XL later this week. I've been on Pixel since the Pixel 3A. Upgraded now not because I wanted a new phone but because I wanted to get a decent trade in value and move on to a phone with 7 years of security updates.
They still didn’t sell, they tried to undercut Samsung and apple’s pricing with similar specs and gained no market traction. Consumers saw it as a budget phone and not for what it is
Labour, import tax, insurance for the deliveries etc. It's a nightmare of things that make it expensive.
And also Marketing and the entire cost of R&D and Android...
50% gross product margin was baseline for make/buy decision in most commercial industries....
Research and development, marketing, shipping, software. $400 is just for hardware
Yeah iPhone Pro is about the same, I think the cost is justified.
I don't understand, what do you mean by a large island in the screen?
Is slippery a good thing now? Just sounds like a good way to sell more phones.. once they are inevitably dropped by butterfingers who go caseless.
Imagine thinking that Apple doesn't do this too, despite their marketing claiming privacy.

The most secure/private way to operate if you must own a smartphone is a Pixel with GrapheneOS.
[deleted]
GrapheneOS works on Pixel 9 and it's variants.
Exactly this. Apple is a product company at heart, whereas Google is a service company. They make HW to be able to sell their services.
Worth it? I don't really have many complaints about my 7 but the screen is pretty scratched up by this point.
Where? I can only get 450 off for my pixel 8 most places
Wait a moment, this private enterprise is turning a profit!
It's actually more expensive hardware than I expected. Some years ago, even iphones would only cost around $250 in hardware
Neither OP nor this article suggests that this indicates the price tag is not justified. 
Christopher Walken? COPD of the fingers?
I would think most people expect the materials to cost LESS than 400
That isn't how any of this works. Not even a little.
But it is sold for about 300 dollars more
True, and by selling your data. But on the hardware I think they just go for break even
Well as a developer I have some ideas
It's a pretty easy guestimate. 10-person team of underpaid devs, manager project manager, system architect etc all getting paid $100k / year is a million dollars a year. Realistically you have way higher salaries and a larger team. R&D burns money really fast.
Try managing a big photo collection in there. Can't bulk delete. Can't close photos account. If you accidentally sync your photos and have more 15 GB of photos in your phone then it's full. And you are trapped into paying Google to get your email, or using your mouse to drag all the photos and delete them slowly.

My mom who doesn't know anything about tech has 14 GB right now. I imagine you'd have to be pretty tech phobic to not fill that up.

(You can use a Chrome extension to bulk delete. But Google counts on you not knowing how to use it.)
> People that buy Google cloud storage because they can't stand to delete 400 pictures from July 4th fireworks from 8 years ago. 

Isn't this part true for the iPhone too, though? 

And both Android and iPhones are made to make more money through services anyway.
Perhaps, but then again most phones use similar screens, batteries, speaker and camera components. Plus Apple upsells their storage which others don’t do to that extent. Despite that, Samsungs profit margin was reported slightly higher than apples a few years ago based on launch day retail prices. But then again, they might make more money with budget phones than premium phones and this was just a overall statistic
Marketing, software, delivery itself.
Licenses also
Retailers take a big chunk of the sales price as well
possible higher tariffs
>Research and development, marketing, shipping, software

I put these in the labor category.
dynamic island ig
Minor grievance, not a perk. And no lol, it's still not a good thing after all this time in the smartphone era but to your point it sells cases. The Pixel case is actually nice.
I didn’t say jack shit about Apple. Imagine that
You think you aren’t getting pushed ads? lol your mere presence around digital ad billboards influences what is shown on them. Your recommended YouTube videos, any time you search anything. Pre popped form fills from android that pass through to CRM. Gmail ads through performance max.
Apple makes a ton of money on ads. They don't sell your data, they sell ad companies access to your demographic.
I wouldnt say it does anything all that much different. I got it because it was a great deal. The biggest thing is that the screen is WAY brighter and I needed that as I work in a very bright place. Other than that, I dunno if other phones can do it currently or really much about it but I can mix two emojis together and its absolutely hilarious.

Also get a screen protector lol
No screen protector?
I got it at Xfinity, I think there might have been a little extra deal on the trade in when it released.
Try [this](https://slickdeals.net/f/17862807-google-play-store-perks-30-off-pixel-9-pixel-9-pro-and-9-pro-xl-pixel-9-pro-160-taxes-after-pixel-7-pro-trade-in-160).

I just placed an order for a P9PXL, trading in my P7P, and my price was $280 including tax
Google store has a trade in deal going until tomorrow. Stack that with the Play Points and Amex discount (check r/Googlepixel for more info on those) and you can get a solid chunk taken off.

1200 for the Pro XL, 30% off with Play Points is $840. $50 for Amex is $790. 450 for your trade in is 340. I'm fairly confident you get below $300 with the Pro, and well below that with the Pixel 9.

They went off the deep end but if you're buying any of the components from yourself, the meaning of the BOM changes a little.
What? They’re both $999
Apple Tax
This gets said all the times and it's just wrong all the time. Google doesn't sell any data, it's actually the opposite of the business model. Google uses whatever data  is collected to target you with ads and makes money by charging advertisers. Data never leaves Google's servers and is never seen by human eyes either.

You can just say ""google shows you ads"" and you don't sound misinformed.
We'll yeah bc it's like the roast chicken at a grocery store.  Gets folks in the door to spending more.
I’ve just read your comment again and I got the wrong end of the stick lol. 
The first half threw me, and you’re probably right in the last part, profit margin probably isn’t as high as you’d expect, and certainly not 100% profit
As a researcher, I haven't a clue. Yet
Interesting info. I don't know if it's different in the US but in Canada, almost nobody pays retail for Samsung whilst almost everybody pays close to retail for Apple. That could distort the costs vs profits a bit.  That said, Samsung does make a lot more of its parts internally. They make their screens, sensors, and the SoCs sold outside North America are mostly Samsung produced. Apple can't fabricate their own chips unless they buy Intel and even if, it would take a while before Intel can do the cutting edge processes that Apple needs.

\^ Thanks

Really? I looked up some prices over here (netherlands) and it was 1299 so I assumed it was the same in the usa.
The $0 Apple tax because they’re both $999
I guess RnD, design, software development, factories, transportation, service support, marketing and others things required to make a pile of materials to a working and usable device are free now? 
Like the whole topic started from that iPhone and Pixel being comparable in this regard.
Luddites of r/gadgets unite!!
I’ll just swap to android where they offer more expensive options because Apple clearly charges way too much for a phone.
Owh but they do!! They do not call it selling they call it sharing, but the data definitely leaves googles servers [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/google-says-it-doesnt-sell-your-data-heres-how-company-shares-monetizes-and](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/google-says-it-doesnt-sell-your-data-heres-how-company-shares-monetizes-and)
just stop. google spies on us and then turns around and sells ads based on that data
Well you can read your comment two ways so I was not sure what you ment :) but we are all clear now 😀
What field do you work in? Private or academic?
Yeah I don’t understand Samsung fanboys who buy on launch day. Wait for half a year and get the same phone for almost half off. Is the new camera really going to make such a huge difference??
They are often made in other countries, thus, tariffs.
Well shit, there's my Americentrism showing.

It's looks like it's the same for the UK too.

Looked at a few countries in western Europe and the Pixel 9 Pro was 1099€ compared to the iPhone 16 Pro varying between 1219 to 1299€
That’s still not 300 more tho
USD it’s 830 for the basic 16 and I think $1k for the pro BUT that’s with a contract. Unlocked it’s more. I *think* the Google pro is like $1kish too but it might be a little more or less (like 1-2 hundred more or less)
You say that as if only Apple had those costs.

Face it, Apple is a company with high margins and ridiculous profits, and a bit reason for that is what people like to call the ""Apple tax"".
Lol

They're companies. *All* of them just want your money, not just apple. The newest flagship iPhone and the newest flagship Samsung cost about the same, at least where I am. If you think Apple is the only one charging way too much for these things, you should probably think again.

I'm not saying one is better than the other. You get whatever you want. All I'm saying is they're all shitty companies. Don't hold any one of them in higher regards than the rest.

>!Also I find it kinda funny that you want expensive options but you also think Apple is overcharging for their phones!<
You understood nothing of that article then. Give me an example of personally identifiable information that goes from a Google server to a third party.
That's exactly what OP said?
What's funny about Samsung's marketing is that the best deals are at launch. Then they sprinkle okay deals throughout the year. But at launch, you can trade in a 7+ y/o Samsung for $500 even if it's broken.


I actually bought the s24u on launch but it was because Samsung offers so many discounts and trade in bonuses. Paid about 60% of the MSRP. That goes back to my original comment. Apple offers very poor trade in offers and the price is either MSRP or their lower educational price. When people buy, they're paying much more for the iPhone.


Re: cameras, it depends on the releases. S23u and S24u are basically the same. The improvement is incremental if you go for the same tier of phone. But if you go up (from a base to a plus, or plus to ultra), there are more cameras and sensors.
Sometimes it's fun to fanboy with a group of other fanboys, around a central event you're all fanboys of.  I wouldn't do it every year, but once a decade or so it can be a lot of fun.  I did it with the iPhone 4, and I'm about to do it again with the Retroid Pocket 5.
EU prices are usually tax included, that makes up the difference.
It’s not “Americacentrism” when the title of this post is in —>***USD***<— Don’t let Reddit gaslight you.
For an inferior product
It’s $830 for the basic 16 in the USA unlocked. Says so on the apple website when checking out. 

“Yes. We’ll help you set up your carrier, number, and rate plan — you even get a discount. And your new iPhone will be unlocked.”
But iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro cost the same $999, despite iPhone reportedly costing more in material. And other competitors cost around the same. They indeed apply to the same market rules as everyone else having their “tax”.
My point was that people always talk about how expensive iPhones are and just ignore that you can spend twice as much on an android.
I absolutely hold Samsung above Apple, they never contracted with Chinese sweatshops
I find it funny how wanting to make profit makes companies shitty nowadays.
why does it have to be personally identifiable to count?
Location data+demographics.... Basically personally identifiable
Well i’ve seen a dutch documentary where they bought anonymous location data from a data broker who got it this way from Google. And you could see anonymous dot which moved from a home to the Whitehouse and then went to the same location abroad as the president. Based on the time of the locations you could easily conclude it was a secret service agent and pinpoint where he/she lived. So yeah its anonymous and no it isnt.
That is a crazy good deal! I would have taken that one too! 

Sure, if you upgrade to a different tier phone, there’s a significant improvement. However, you could wait for half a year and usually get a much better deal. I suppose it also depends on your location. I received a brand new phone from work, but otherwise, I’ve reached a point where all the technology I have meets my requirements. If my Mac were to die tomorrow, I would likely purchase the M2 Pro or M3 Pro again. There’s no advantage in having the latest generation based on my current needs.
Oh I 100% get you! Plus I tend to be an early adopter. I would love to have a Vision Pro for instance but I’d rather wait a few years to get a second hand one or a budget version. It will drop in price either way
Why would that matter for one phone but not the other? Both are taxed, right?
Apple tax. They overcharge.
Let's also be gentle with the word ""gaslight"".  ""Mislead"" might be better here.  ""Gaslight"" implies a wilful intention to manipulate, by knowingly speaking from a fictitious reality.  I don't think that's what's going on here.
 so defensive
Let’s stop pretending that opinions are facts and that everyone has the same needs. You understand that, right?
Profit is fine. Nothing in life is free. I get that. But screwing over customers and the average folk is more than just wanting to make profit.
Because those goal posts won't move themselves!
Anonymous location data is by definition not private. It simply means ""there's a customer there"" but again google doesn't sell individual locations. Says ""there's xxx people here in that segment you want to show ads too"". Google doesn't sell individual data points whatever that video says it doesn't work that way, I know because I make them work that way.
prices shown in the US are sometimes not tax included tax are added on checkout.

while most of the world price is already tax inclusive.
One has the Apple tax too! /s, though not really. They are mad at the forced policies from the EU.
Getting downvoted for stating the truth, classic reddit. 

Europe Iphone 16 pro : 1300 euros = $1398 

US highest state tax in Cali = $1099
Give me examples of screwing the average folk. Selling a “400 dollar phone” for 2000?

Not necessarily, it seems like American phone prices are often subsidised by extreme monthly rates on your actual phone plans.

But also, in the UK the base iPhone 16 Pro is £999 including tax, which is €1,198, not €1300.

Apple Ireland's price is €1,239 including tax, not €1300.

Sales tax in the UK and Ireland is 20%.

Sales tax in california is a third of that at 7.25%

So an iPhone in the UK pre tax is £832

An iPhone in the USA pre-tax is $999 which is £776

There will obviously be a few extra fees, duty etc, but the actual difference is quite low.
Welp, then how about no more Reddit? Go outside.
I'm not trying to sound snarky at all. But I really think you should be able to think of these things yourself.

Having marginal, barely noticeable upgrades year over year because there's no competition, and thus no incentive to improve. Having the bare minimum of software support - Apple in this regard has been really good in the past, providing software updates to their phones many years after release. Most android companies used to provide only 2 or 3 years, though that has changed recently. Samsung and Google both promised 7 years on their latest phones. Again, just because I praised Apple doesn't mean it's a good company. They lost the lawsuit to open up their phones to 3rd party app stores, and only followed through on doing that in European countries, where said law applies. Android on the other hand is very open about 3rd party stores and app installation in general. But while they do have that, there's privacy concerns on android phones (though I'm not too well versed in this as I haven't done much research).

There's tons more, and going through them all one by one would take all day.
Except gas for some reason
actually I think theres a recent policy that restaurants are required to have their prices tax inclusive. at least that was I read a year a go.
Please do

No, because when you have such an extreme take and somebody questions you on that, then it means this person questioning you does not think the way you do, so you'd have to explain your POV. Hence the question. Simple.

Nothing you mentioned is screwing the average folk though? I mean, it's more of a question about preference rather than screwing people over. 

Tech has gotten so far that any minimal advancement requires more and more power from something and somebody else. It's not Apple specific nor is it phones specific either. It's everywhere. Diminishing returns. 

When it comes to 3rd party apps, as a lifelong Apple user, I was and am against it. Mainly because it gets messy, introduces security risks and essentially it lessens the value, security, comfort (etc) of a closed system. 
Imagine a private school with ""strict"" rules. They set the rules for everything - teachers, students, what not. That means that they dictate the ""level of education"" there. Now if that school goes public, it most probably will lose at least some of this ""high level"". 

So the TLDR is that you did not give a single example of Apple screwing the average person.
Not that I’ve seen.
There is not. In the US it's required to line item the taxes generally, as well as other fees that are not paid to the company you're buying from.
You’re probably thinking of something like we have here in California where the prices have to be inclusive of fees. Like resort fees, ticket fees, healthcare fees, all of the little bullshit fees that business love to tag on when you check out or pay. Restaurants ended up getting carved out of this new law, which sucks. 

Taxes are separate.
Fair enough about the security risk of the 3rd party apps and stores, but I believe consumers should have the freedom to take such risks if they want. Just having the ability to do it doesn't mean it'll immediately allow hackers access to your phone. So if I want to download a random app from a sketchy looking site, I should have the ability to. The consequences of that should fall entirely on me, yes, but I still want to be able to do it. It also opens the market to other companies/people, loosening Apple's grip on their software market. I'm an iPhone user too, but not being able to install 3rd party apps, or older versions of apps (which is somewhat important to me), is really annoying. They don't even allow 3rd party browsers on iOS and iPadOS. Every browser is just a copy of Safari with a different skin. Not being able to run my Firefox plugins on my iPad pro really makes it annoying to browse the web on. Plus, they're already allowing it in the EU. Region locking such a thing, that is based purely on software, shows that they don't want *anyone* to be able to do it. And that they're only allowing the few people that they are because they are being forced to.

Also, I don't know what you mean when you say that my take is extreme. Would appreciate it if you explained yourself there.

And as for the tech improvement statement, you're right. But Apple makes their own chips (which, might I add, are super super powerful. I know their m4 chips in their iPads trade blows with desktop level CPUs), so they don't really have to really on other companies like android companies do. But again, I do understand the diminishing returns for these things. So you have a very good point. But without competition, they would undoubtedly stagger, as Intel did with their chips until AMD came out with Ryzen. Yes it's comparing apples to oranges but the point still remains that without competition, they would have no reason to improve.

If you want a specific example of Apple screwing over it's customers, I don't remember exactly what it currently is, but buying a Mac and the same mac with more memory + storage will change the price by 2x. So if you want 32gb ram + 1tb storage, that would cost the same as buying two units with 16gb ram + 509gb storage. But you won't be getting the cpu and the other components, obviously. Again, I don't know the details of this but I saw a post on the mac subreddit (I believe) a few days ago. Just in general, limiting users and then charging ridiculous prices for upgrades that would otherwise be really cheap (or at least cheaper).
It’s not fair enough tbh, the system is closed anyway and sideloaded apps are still sandboxed. Everyone can already install 3rd party apps on ios, but if you want the ability to do it without hiccups, Apple charges you 100$ yearly for a „developer certificate“",2024-11-05 19:59:45,1873,151,https://9to5google.com/2024/11/05/google-pixel-9-pro-material-cost-report/
Gadgets,The Pixel 9a could feature the same main camera as Google's most expensive phone | The upcoming budget phone could feature the same 48MP primary camera as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.,"

Comments:
Most foldables have gimped camera specs and don’t have the one the main flagship has, presumably because of space.
This is bad. The 9 folds camera is much worse than the main 9 and 9 pro.
I thought the Pro 9 Fold had the weakest camera of the pixel 9 line up though?
This honestly just speaks poorly for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.
Does that include the lens?
Mp don't mean a thing now on phone.  It all upscale images
But it will have no storage room and force you to pay a subscription.
I got a Pixel 7 for free through my provider. I want my money back. This phone is awful.
Google's most expensive phone is not the one with the best camera though. Dumb headline but that's not on the OP
But they'll lower the quality artificially by software, I guarantee it
[deleted]
And how exactly would that benefit the company?
There is no arguing that, but that doesn't make them a good camera set for this phone.
D'uh...so it doesn't cannibalise the sale of the top model. Are you all stupid, or what? Business 101
Fold is a different market segment and still have enough hiccups (even without the camera) for it to not cannibalise their regular phones. 


If the pro and regular versions can coexist at the market share they have, fold is a bigger threat to Samsung versions that pixel pros",2024-10-22 17:41:43,157,14,https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9a-camera-leak-3492886/
