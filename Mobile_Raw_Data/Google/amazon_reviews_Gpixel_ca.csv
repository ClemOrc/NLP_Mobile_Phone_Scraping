It is responsive, has a great camera, and offers top-tier support from Google. I recommend this, especially if you are looking for one of the best Android experiences right now."

I recently purchased the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Fold. Both phones delivered excellent performance with no lag at all. However, the charging experience with both devices was disappointing. Neither phone included a charging brick, only the cable, which made finding a compatible charger a challenge. Google phones don’t support most third-party fast chargers, and only Google’s proprietary charger works effectively. This limitation was frustrating, as the phones often charged at a very slow rate.

Ultimately, I decided to return both phones and instead opted for the Honor Magic V3 Fold. This phone not only supports fast charging but also features the thinnest borders when folded, making it a superior choice in my opinion."

I don't like phablets, the large format size that Samsung seems to prefer. This Pixel 9 Pro is only slightly bigger than my old phone but still a manageable size. It's fast and not filled with bloatware leaving more space for my stuff. The features are fantastic. I would recommend this phone to anyone who asks."

I hope it will not happen again.
