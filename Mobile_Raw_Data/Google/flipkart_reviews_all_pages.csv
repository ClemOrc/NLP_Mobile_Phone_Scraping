Camera is great as always, design is by far the best and feels like a flagship premium device

The battery has been improved as it lasts for more than a day. No heating issues are faced so far as well :)

The only con is the charging speed is still very slow as compared to other premium phones, it takes more than 1.5 hours for full charge.",

The phone is fast, feels like it already knows your next step/action.

,,"Review from a long term Iphone User:
( Exchanged my Iphone 14Pro)

Camera Performance:

The Pixel 9's camera has consistently impressed me, particularly in low-light environments. The AI-driven image processing is exceptional, capturing intricate details and vibrant colors. While I have occasionally observed slight overexposure or blown-out highlights in bright lighting conditions, these are minor issues that don't significantly detract from the overall quality. I believe a software update co...

,,"Review after using Pixel 9 for one month:

I bought this during the sale with cashback and exchange for around 61k, which was a decent price.

I was using OnePlus 7t for the past 5 years and upgraded to this device as I'm not a big fan of apple. This did not disappoint me. It's great update from OnePlus 7t which itself was a great phone to use.

Pros:
1. The build quality is great.
2. The size is quite handy, this phone will definitely suit you if you prefer a smaller phone.
3. Battery lasts ...
