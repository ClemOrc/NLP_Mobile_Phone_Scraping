Samsung Galaxy S24 review,soheilnilavari2,2024-02-01 17:39:03,143,https://gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s24-review-2663.php,Beyllionaire,87,2024-02-01 21:57:46,"Basically the S23 with a slightly different frame and brighter display with dynamic refresh rate.  Same cameras and same battery life.  Exynos throttles quickly and heavily. The phones heats up under load.  In short, the main Exynos problems are still there: bad modem that will negatively impact the battery life, throttling and overheating despite the bigger vapor chamber (though it seems that the S24+ is less impacted as it's bigger).  I hope they bring new cameras, faster charging and a better SoC for the S25.  But you can't deny that Exynos 2400 is far superior to 2200. Looking at the benchmark scores, it's quite evident that the Tensor G3 was based on Exynos 2200 and not 2400, hence the terrible Pixel battery life despite the huge batteries. The benchmark scores of Tensor G3 are almost identical to Exynos 2200 in the S23FE."

Exynoss throttles quite heavily under sustained load.  The rest is pretty much the same as last year's model though the reviews mentions its using a virtual proximity sensor which I've never seen mentioned in previous models

Copied all the same apps directly over using smart switch, and suddenly my screenshot ability was blocked at every turn. I'm  grown man, why do I need app developers to decide for me that I can't use features of my phone because it's too dangerous for me to record my own personal info? I don't get paper bills, so when I've needed to show documents to the government or court or a landlord, I've taken a ss of my bank app, now I can't. I just got my mom switched over to my phone plan, but I couldn't ss available phones, plans or promotions to text to her, because my carrier's app blocks ss. Like OP said, private browsers also block ss. I use the samsung native dynamic lock screen, that changes the background photo every time you turn the screen on. When I swipe over to view the image without my notifications, I can no longer ss the image because of security(!?). To clarify; I can ss when all my private notifications are on the screen, but when I swipe over to se the clean image, suddenly there is a security issue? Why has samsung changed their phones to give apps the ability to override physical button presses, and control other apps (camera is a separate app that should not be controlled by anyone but the owner).   This is clearly not for the protection of users, outside of very limited cases, like banking apps (but I still argue adults  who have access to the accounts should have their own discretion), but the fact that this extends to hulu and netflix and other media apps tips their hand at the real motivation. This is just companies looking out for each other, not the consumer, as always. They don't want people taking ss of media, and they use the back door of protecting our account data as a way to sneak in. The most annoying thing is, no one is pirating media with screenshots. You physically can't pirate a movie or tv show with screenshots. Even if you could take over 40 shots per second over the course of the video, then stich them all together, you'd still have no sound. This is a solution in search of a problem that just isn't there. People's info isn't getting out because they're taking screenshots of it, it's because the companies that claim to look out for us have lax security and get hacked for 100.000 people's info at once, or just sell it to whoever asks. They don't give a damn about protecting us"

Also, the battery life could have been better, as mine is an SD3 version. I am on 4G 65% of the time; maybe that is the reason for battery drainage. Furthermore, after unplugging from the charger, the battery rapidly drains to 90%. I like the routine a lot.  also use the phone in a light performance profile. don't game at all. Don't use Facebook. that's it. For me, if I could use the camera for point-and-shoot, it would have been an almost perfect phone. camera lacks details, and quality is not flagship level for me."

I went from an A21, and there's barely a difference. The camera is better, but is inconvenient when setting it down on a surface, but thats beside the point. It's inner systems are TRASH. I work from my phone and the just the general way the phone functions is absolutely ridiculous. This phone is what you'd expect from 10 years ago, not 2024. It's SO buggy. Texting, emailing, etc, is a nightmare. Auto correct is trash, as well as general functions related to this. If I wouldn't have gotten it for free, I'd 10000% be returning it."

The radio sofware quality control is terrible. After a couple of months, a monthly patch killed my ability to call and text, but it started working again immediately after the next montly update was applied. It is finicky with eSims from various carriers even when the phone is listed as supported.  I was thinking of trying the S23 or S24 but I see people complaining about problems similar to mine with the newer models too.  Even a week ago before I replaced my S22 with an iPhone, the S22 randomly turned off WiFi calling on both sims, would switch my primary sim on its own and require me to turn off and on sims in some locations before it would connect.  The Bixby software also is not up to par as location triggers do not work if you have cellular turned off.  All of the above problems just work flawlessly on the dual sim iPhone I replaced the S22 with.  I always avoided iPhones due to having more apps and control with Android but that does not seem to apply today in 2024. Samsung has quality control issues so I am done with them. My wife has less problems with her S22 but only uses a single sim. Her phone does require frequent reboots though."

The ultrawide in particular is 4 generations old (still doesn't even have autofocus).   These really needed to be upgraded this generation, and the need sticks out even more on the base S24 that does not have the other non-camera upgrades that the plus has over its predecessor.  The S20 got a full array of 3 new sensors, and the S22 got 2 of 3 new sensors.  We're at the 2 generation cadence again but got nothing this generation."

I'm guessing not many use the cameras (which is fine if it's not a need or priority) or have ever used another manufacturer with better camera hardware/processing.   Using a Pixel vs base model S22-24 series devices is extremely jarring, and a lot of techtuber reviewers that I've seen don't put these base models into scenarios where I feel like these cameras systems are challenged. And don't get me started on how awful the S22-S24 10MP 3x telephoto lens is.    If the S24+ has an MSRP of $999 (ignoring trade-ins, that is market dependent), it's priced above the cheapest P8P and OP12. I expect a ton more than finally getting a 1440p screen and 12GB RAM that should have been there in the S21+ to now. Samsung has their consumer base in a bit of a trap. Everytime you go to try something else, they offer insane pre-order deals and trade-ins with tons of carrier support.    I expect more out of this community than benchmark score hype. That's what it's devolved to."

I have the phone and it overheats easily without even playing games.  I had the Zenfone 10 and Xiaomi 13 which have a similar size and they'd never overheat even when playing games. Go look at the stress tests, you can only get that peak exynos performance for a few minutes before the chip throttles.   Like GSMArena said, Samsung didn't make the vapor chambers larger to get better performance but because it was an absolute necessity.  Even the S24+ with its larger size overheats easily and throttles. The Snapdragon versions won't have the same problem, quote me on that."

The cameras on the S23/S24 are really good and can absolutely compare to the Pixel 8/Iphone 15. Are they the best? No. But Pixel isn't the best either. There is no ""best camera"".   One phone will be excellent in one area but not be as good in other areas. For example the main sensor of the Pixel 8 and its software processing ""might"" produce better photos but that definition of ""better photos"" depends on if you prefer natural looking photos or saturated ones. The fact that people are currently complaining that the S24 displays don't look saturated enough makes me believe that people generally prefer saturation as it's more eye candy.   But then the S24 offers a real telephoto camera that takes better 3x pics than the Pixel 8 (according to most reviews) and the selfie camera is also much better.   What the S23/S24 provide you is a complete camera system that works great for most people in all situations. Low light photography is gonna remain a challenge for every phone, even with a 1"" sensor. If you want the absolute best cameras, you'll need to buy a Chinese flagship phone."

They're really good. But they need to be upgraded. Especially the ultrawide (autofocus) and telephoto (larger sensor).  The processing of the images is independent from the camera quality. Your pics look saturated because Samsung wants them to look saturated. They seem to have toned down the saturation with the S24.

There is no ""best camera"".    I feel as if I'm being fairly critical. I have used the S20, S21+, S23+, Pixel 7, and now a Pixel 8 Pro in the last 4 years. And sure, you can choose the camera system that suits your needs the best, but half my point is the lack of hardware innovation compared to similar priced phones and suffering from the same issues year on year. It was heavily criticized in the 9to5Google S24U review as well and that's not even the base models.    Any phone these days will do just fine in bright light scenarios, though. I will agree with you there, that post processing styles will matter more at that point. But after a static, well lit scene, is when my and others concerns with the camera system come into play.    The 3x is a nice to have compared to options without it, but I am mostly comparing the P8P at $899/999 to the S24+ at $999 or I suppose the OP12 at $799 to the S24 at $799. Sure there are other variables at play for pricing but support *promises*, display quality, and chipsets (maybe not Tensor, subjective) are comparable.    Anyways, people can buy what they want and be happy! I just want a bit of innovation amongst Samsung's complacency recently. The landscape today is different than it was a couple years ago."

I live in Shanghai. But you buy s24 to have something else, not for the best pics (even if they are great). Also, samsung is giving this 7 years that is great, Chinese brands are not so focused on this part, due to the fact here you buy a flagship for 5000 rmb and you change every year or 2. easy."

The real low light photography kings are those Chinese phones with 1"" sensors: Xiaomi 13 Ultra, Vivo X100 Pro, Oppo Find X6 Pro.   But keep in mind that there is no ultimate camera phone, they all have their strengths and weaknesses. One might do better in low light but do worse for zoomed pics.

Only test actually testing that mobility part is call time. And that one fell 20% from S23 despite of even slightly bigger battery.

Most phone makers simply use larger/more sensors over the years and that's it. The main innovation we got those past 5 years was the periscope camera.  But between a Pixel 8 Pro and a Pixel 4 XL, there isn't much hardware innovation going on outside of the larger sensor and periscope camera like I said earlier. Most of the innovation is software-based.   One interesting hardware innovation though is the continus zoom that Sony introduced on the Xperia 1, which would eliminate the need for multiple zoom cameras on a a single phone.  I hope they continue to develop that and sell it to other companies that make better use of their hardware than they do (Sony's software processing is horrendous)."

Longer battery life and higher performance on both the CPU and GPU. In what way is it not up to Snapdragon level? Remember that we are talking specifically about the Snapdragon 8 gen 2 vs the Exynos 2400, since the person I replied to said the S23 was a better phone than the S24.  I don't really buy your reasoning that you are dismissing every single area where the Exynos beats the Snapdragon by saying things like ""well that benchmark doesn't matter, and this benchmark doesn't matter either"", which basically results in only ""call time"" being left. If you just want long call time and don't care about anything else, get a dumbphone. If you want to use your phone for anything else, the S24, even with an Exynos chip, will be a better phone than the S23. Higher performance, longer battery life, more features, better screen, better speakers, the list goes on and on.  &#x200B;  Talking to Qualcomm fanboys feels like talking to Apple fanboys.

Exynos 990 as a processor wasn't the best and was known to have heating issues, so Exynos 2400's better efficiency and vapour chamber should make it less prone to getting warm/hot and therefore help in battery life. But the small size battery due to its size is making me concerned.  I don't think wifi usage would be a problem for S24 and should give good battery life in those situation. How does it behave with 5G should answer the question (especially in warm ambient temperature of summer season). I'm not sure how to find an answer to that."

You're still just speculating. You're not speculating that LTE uses more power than Wi-Fi, but you are speculating that the disparity between the Exynos and Snapdragon would have been bigger if the test was different. We don't know that. You assume it would. The tests we have today says that the S24 with the Exynos 2400 gets longer battery life than the S23 with the Snapdragon 8 gen 2.  &#x200B;  >Single core improvement isn't really that much.  7% higher isn't that meaningless. But you are ignoring the other areas where the difference is a lot bigger.  &#x200B;  And you still haven't given a single argument for why the S23 is better. All you have done so far is say (without evidence) that the modem is better in the Snapdragon 8 gen 2 and therefore it is a better phone to buy. You haven't backed that claim up with anything, and all other areas I have bought up where the S24 is better you have dismissed.  Even IF (that is a massive if) you are correct that the modem is less efficient, you would still have to prove that it would make any meaningful difference. Would it be the difference between making it through a full day vs not making it through a full day? Because if the difference is let's say 12 hours vs 13 hours of usage and most people end up at around let's say 10 hours, then it doesn't matter anyway (numbers for illustratory purposes only). It still wouldn't be enough for 2 days, and more than enough for 1 day.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  I think it's funny that you are calling me a fanboy, when you're the one saying an old phone with worse battery life in the tests we have seen, worse screen, worse photos/videos, worse CPU performance (in all tests), worse GPU performance, worse speakers, shorter update policy, harder reparability, etc... and you say the other phone is better because ""it has a Qualcomm modem, which means it will get better battery life in certain scenarios although I can't prove it"".

Anyway it's propably shocking news to you that not all people use phone for playing around and watching videos. I couldn't care less about some gaming time or video playback time, or some new speakers.  High fully multithreaded synthetic benchmark numbers aren't very meaningfull in most consumer uses, because lots of code is serial in nature and needs single core performance.  As for repairability before talking about that user should be able to change battery without any special tools and methods. All current phones fail in that. Samsung actually had IP rated S-serie models with interchangeable battery, before they decided it's more profitable to sell new phones than batteries.  Battery wear is really what decides phone's usage life for many people, because typical usage habits are hard on battery and it takes specific treating of battery to keep it good for 5+ years."

It's also a big difference between saying ""phone X is only better in things I don't care about"" and saying ""phone X is worse"". If you don't care about performance, the screen, the speakers, the updates, and the other parts of the long list then maybe the S23 isn't the phone for you either? And in that case it isn't because ""the other phone has a Snapdragon"", which was the argument being put forth by someone else before you decided to jump into the conversation and speak for that other person.  Let me remind you that this conversation started because I asked someone why they thought the S23 was a better buy than the S24, and the argument I got was back was ""Snapdragon"". Don't you agree that that's something a fanboy would say? Judging things solely on the brand and disregarding things like benchmarks and such.  &#x200B;  I also think you are putting a lot of emphasis on call battery life and I am not so sure it will actually matter in real life. As I said earlier, it doesn't matter if the difference ends up being several hours if both phones end up in the span between ""more than enough for one day, but not enough for 2 days"". You still will need to charge it every day.  I also think there are a lot of areas where the S24 is superior to the S23. Now, you might not care about any of those and only care about the one thing where the S23 *MIGHT* be better than the S24, but that's your preference and I don't think a lot of people who are looking at buying a phone at this price point will agree with you."
