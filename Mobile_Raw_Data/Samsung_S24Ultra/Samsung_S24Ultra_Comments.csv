I personally didn't see any problem lately, my phone still lasts me a full work day even after all this time.  Try to set automatic brightness in the settings, alongside FHD+ resolution and check if adaptive refresh rate is turned on. If you have changed a lot of settings or you installed different apps that are heavy on the battery that could also be the case.  The worst part scenario, it may be a tipical battery wear which u can easily solve by changing the battery, it won't make the phone last like day 1, but it will most definitely help."

That's 500 odd (built in apps and processes) merrily depleting data (and battery in the background) you need to take the time and go to settings, then apps and scroll through each and turn off background data and set battery to optimised or restricted.

Everyone thinks this is some kind of benchmark, but any phone no matter what manufacturer will have bad pictures of the moon. The phone's camera lenses are physically too small to collect much light, it's still a night photo. Even very good cameras can't do great without a proper night lens, and there's a reason such a lens costs a lot.  Smartphones try to compensate for the small lens and problems with these lights with strong post-processing, which can be seen acutely in photos of the moon. All these comparisons simply do not make sense. Maybe check how it actually behaves at night, how it performs in better/worse lighting, rather than checking the moon"

Perhaps I should have chosen taking a scenic route rather than the fastest.   I'm not a gamer. 90% or more of my screen time is on my desktop computer, not my phone. I don't use the camera every day but the speed and great camera is there when I want them.   When I charge to 100% I usually get 3 days (sometimes 4) use, with power savings turned on. My hope is that less frequent charging will push back when I'll need to get a new battery installed.   Nothing wrong with using your phone (or car) to the maximum (when you can do that legally), but that doesn't mean there is something wrong if someone chooses to 'go slower'."

I in USA have US Cellular as carrier.   If alot of people not having the problem vs more people having the problem that should mean there is some kind of fix for the people with the problem.   Samsung just doesn't wanna admit it. They would lose to much profit having to switch/fix so many phones.   I'm happy u don't have the problem.   Guess we a lil rare breed. üòÜ.

Having my s pen and watch to control my phone while in my pocket or laying around and I can change my music or broadcasts or anything I need to do.  I'm really afraid we lost support for it since they saying only 1% of people use it.  Back in the day that's 1 big thing that always helped the old Note series being a kick ass phone.  Now basically paying same price with no cool upgrades. Lol.  Sorry for the rant.

WHEN I take my case off of the phone and swipe a magnet across the bottom this doesn't happen either therefore you can deduce from this information that it is a problem with a second set of magnets on the case not registering with the phone and not a problem with the phone.IF THE SCREEN DOES GO INTO SVIEW MODE WITH A SWIPE OF THE üß≤ MAGNET ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN then you can assume the magnets on the bottom of the flap are somehow not registering with the phone but the phone is registering the case being there.....I hope this helps if I'm able to get pictures of this  process I will post them. But i tried my bestb to describe this

Sorry man, but I'm guessing the case is just broken/malfunctioning?  If you go to the phones settings, you can use the search üîç at the top and look for ""Cover Screen'  If the case is not installed this option is hidden.  If the case *is* installed and this is still hidden, I'd venture to guess whatever handshake happens to register the case is simply not happening for whatever reason.   If you don't have any kind of stickers or one of those custom MagSafe things or whatever between the case and the phone (on either the front or back) then I lean towards the case malfunctioning.   There was a similar case noted here ([link](https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-s24-series/smart-cover-not-working/td-p/9135994)) it seems to me that they had to get theirs replaced."

Need opinions like many I think. I already had an s23 ultra for 1 year that I had it returned because the size of the phone hurt my hands.. I was very satisfied with the photo quality and the battery life. Then after resuming this s23 ultra I switched to a.z flip 5 7 months ago. I am satisfied with it, I love the foldable side and the space saving in pockets etc. But I don't find the photo quality great and the battery is a disaster. I recharge it twice during the day. Still no update for one ui 7.So I want to change but I'm not between the s25 ultra with photos and even better AI. Or the fold 6 which I don't know yet?Thank you in advance for your feedback"

I have 2 different cases, one from EFM, a slim case that doesn't add anything much to the bulk of the phone, and just makes it feel like the original with a rubber back and sides, and I also have the cheapest magsafe case I could find on Amazon, in Australia, which was only $5, and also doesn't do much to the bulk or weight, while adding straight sides and diagonally cut corners. At a size like this, a few millimetres of case doesn't matter to me, especially when I have a Magsafe power bank always attached to it.  With regards to your concerns, if I were to go without a case, I wouldn't care about the small scratches, and the bumps would annoy me a bit, if they cause discomfort to me using it. I would only really be extremely worried about scratches. I moved from an old iPhone 14 Pro, and once, I dropped it from around a meter on concrete. I had a wallet case on, and, when I inspected the damage later, the back glass was cracked. Thankfully  I had a camera guard on (though it might‚Äôve been the cause of the cracks), so my camera lenses were safe, but the actual back was pretty cracked.  Edited this twice to add this and fix a single I."

I got 420 pounds for my iphone 14 pro max 256 gb and I got 187 pounds student discount. Paid about 609 pound for the phone and called it a day. Same phone now cost 800 with trade in because they readjusted the price of my iphone down to 320 pound... student discount has also gone down.

Even a lot of the branded ones are made in China. I'll be running out of a lot of stuffs to use and wear if I avoid all products from China. Oh and I'm a Filipina with Chinese ancestry now living in the UK. Asians have been buying stuff from China as they are becoming a monopoly of things/products being sold ever since I can remember.

Example: Some Swiss Watches are made in China and they are high quality, because the Swiss company just use the land and the work force to assemble the watches for cheaper prices, this is ok and 95% companies do that in the world we live in.

Initially I changed CSC from XUG(Dubai) to INS. Which enabled call recording, although jio and airtel 5G worked fine out of the box. But then I realized I wasn't getting software updates, hence merely changing CSC wasn't enough in my case.  So I downloaded and flashed the whole ass INS firmware via ODIN. Now I'm getting the updates just fine and everything works great. Didn't even lose any data during flashing process because I selected 'HOME CSC'.  You won't get any warranty though and you can't even buy Samsung care. I brought this phone for 72k, which was 50k cheaper at the time as compared to Indian version. Paying 30-50k extra for warranty isn't worth it."

If I had a S24 Ultra the previous year I would not upgrade either unless got a seriously good trade in deal. Had a S22 Ultra before and honestly air gestures were a bit of a gimmick and hard to get right consistently so quicker to use apps without them. Remote camera control can be substituted with watch camera app, holding up a palm to take shot, or audio commands. Not saying it is nice taking features away from an Ultra phone - in my opinion it really should have seen an upgrade to 16GB ram as the base model comes with 12 also but as I find iOS so frustrating in many ways needed to change."

They really did a bad thing here by removing those Bluetooth compatibility. But that ain't a major deal breaker for people's who don't use it. Like come on , even if someone uses the s pen for documents or signing their stuffs. They don't really need those functions cause you still could do them with the current s pen which comes with the s25u. But i do agree with you that , you don't really need to upgrade if you already own the s24u. S24u still looks a lot more premium to me."

Has still close to the best ANC the market has to offer, and while newer offerings from Bose, Sony, Sennheiser, and B&W have leapfrogged it's quality, it's often price half compared to the newer ones so it's still pretty good.   IMO it's better than the Sony ULT or Sennhesier Accentum overall, but is priced similar just because it's an older flagship."

Since Sony acquired Audeze, i've been waiting for them to release something similar to my  WH-1000XM5 with planar magnetic drivers.

When I get up from my phone or pc and go to the bathroom, the XM4s will cut out (not more than 30ft away uninterrupted). I have the Bose hooked to the tv in the livingroom and I can walk about anywhere with no interruptions.  \- The XM4s use capacitive touch controls, which are finicky and get triggered when I raise my arms above my head. This was getting annoying until I finally just turned it all off.   \- The Bose's PHYSICAL BUTTONS are much preferred.  \- I like the sound of both and the noise cancelling is excellent with either (maybe give the win to the XM4s?)  \- The Bose ear cups are painfully too small. So I gave the Bose to my wife and for tv use, while I keep the XM4s for myself. Their earcups are actually big enough for my ears to fit inside.   \- Took the XM4s on a plane some months ago and they performed like the champ they are. They also fold up nice and small in their travel case. From everything (negative) I've read about the XM5s, I wouldn't want them."

I ordered the 1TB S25 Ultra for ¬£1164 with discounts and includes free buds plus after a review free case and charger. If I ordered a 1TB S24 Ultra from somewhere new I bet I would be paying round about the same. Possible it could be a few hundred ¬£ cheaper but seeing as get new chipset, new display that sounds like resolves the grain issue, cameras that potentially sound like they have resolved the shutter speed issue, plus software updates through to 2032! Seems a good deal to me. I know Bluetooth has been removed from the spen. And whilst I never really used air gestures reliably enough and can use my palm to take photos instead I don‚Äôt condone Samsung removing features from an Ultra model and if the base handset models come with 12GB ram then the Ultra should have 16GB but as with the AI push this is the way manufacturers are going saving on hardware costs and pushing releases on more software based features which at some point they  will charge you more for. I will be interested to see how Samsung handle that part though, as they rely on Google and Gemini for a lot of functionality will Samsung charge a AI subscription on top of a Google One subscription with Gemini or bundle it as one. At least you can turn it off."

I'll use the iPhone feature description to hopefully give more info. You can have multi photo lock screen and tap through to select the photo that you want and then it will stay as that photo even when you lock and unlock you phone. I haven't found any info that says that i can do that on Samsung so I'm assuming its just not something i can do sadly unless someone knows if it is a thing

That reduction can't be explained by battery degradation alone.

However, if you only watch videos, play a little bit of less power consuming games, and social media, you can easily get 6 to 7 hours of SOT. And also don't look too much on your phone's battery percentage. Just use your phone like normal, and the phone will automatically adjust the battery life for you. I was amazed how I could easily get 1 day without charging doing normal stuff on my phone. Provided I also do on the Adaptive Battery in the settings, but all my settings are turned on, like 120hz, and QHD resolution. I read here in reddit, use your phone as per what you paid it for. Don't limit it just because you feel the battery percentage is getting low very fast. You dont notice that a certain percentage of the battery keeps a long time hanging there.   I learned from my experience in apple that from 100 to 90%, it reduces very slow,  but for android its not. Hehehe"

You'll pay less and you will have an unlocked phone you can use with any carrier you want without having to jump through hoops.   Buying a phone straight out from a carrier is a mug's game.

I was with Cricket, I repeat, WAS with Cricket before they went to AT&T. After going to AT&T Service went to pure hell. 1st couple of months was good, gained 5g and even had HBO Max. Then came the slow throttling, the prioritizing, the caps. Areas I was normally getting a signal in I no longer was, even with 5G at the top along with bars, not exaggerating. I suggest Visible(Verizon). I've been with them since start up and their service is crisp, it's gonna keep you fast, throttling back and forth from 5gUW to 5g to 4lte only downside is there is no phone number for them, chat only but trust me, you won't need em once you learn the system."

S24 Series Update (February 7-8, 2025):  The Galaxy S24 series will be the first to receive One UI 7.  2. S23 Series Update (February 10-20, 2025):  The Galaxy S23 series will shortly receive the update after the S24 series.   2. Older S Series Models Update:  Samsung typically rolls out major updates to previous flagship models within days or weeks after the latest series.   The Galaxy S22 series and older models, such as the S21, will follow in the weeks leading up to March 31, 2025.      ---  Why This Timeline?  Flagship Priority: Newer flagship models (S24, S23) typically receive updates first, followed by older generations.  Samsung‚Äôs March 31 Deadline: Since Samsung has committed to updating all S series devices by the end of March, all eligible models should receive One UI 7 by or before March 31, 2025.  Staggered Rollout: Updates are released in phases, considering region, carrier, and testing.    ---  Conclusion:  The One UI 7 rollout for the S series will start with the S24 series on February 8, 2025, with the S23 series following around February 10‚Äì14. Other eligible S series models (S22, S21, etc.) will gradually receive the update, ensuring all devices are updated by March 31, 2025.  Note: Samsung's regional update release schedules may cause variations in the availability of S23 and S24 series updates.  Therefore, while the projected launch window is February 7-20, your device's update may arrive later."

However, I highly doubt it will help unless you take some steps. First, close all unnecessary apps and set everything to the lowest settings, including display brightness. Turn on power-saving mode. When you scroll down from the top of the screen, make sure to enable that feature. Adjust the brightness to the minimum level that allows you to see clearly, and turn off Bluetooth.  If you don‚Äôt have NetGuard, consider getting it the next time your phone is charged. Opt for the GitHub version instead of the Play Store version, as the Play Store version doesn‚Äôt allow ad blocking like the GitHub version does. Set battery protection to Maximum.  When you lock your phone, ensure that it‚Äôs completely dark and not displaying any moving screens. Open an app like Messages, scroll up, and then close ALL apps. In the top left corner, you should see ""active in background"" if there are any apps running in the background. I'm sure there are some. If any of them look suspicious, take note of them and investigate later to determine if they are supposed to be there.  I typed this quick and fast didn't double check but yeah if you need the screen on majority of that 7 hours then no."

Before last full charge I actually used my phone more than usuall because I was on video calls for work and it seemed to drop from 5 days 8 hours to 4 days 13 hours but even then by the time it's well past the 4 day mark so fulll charge definitely lasts over 5 days
