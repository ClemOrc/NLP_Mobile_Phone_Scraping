post,1fg4mnc,Xiaomi,A week with 14 Ultra : The Report,"A background.
Die-hard Android enthusiast, since the first days of Android. Dozens of custom roms installed, dozens of bootloaders unlocked.

Android purist more or less, with majority of my devices in past 14 years being Sony Xperias and/or Google Nexus/Pixels.
Several Xiaomis too, A (A1 and A2) and T (9T and 10T) series ones. Never owned a full-fledged Xiaomi flagship though.

My last phone was Pixel 7, and although an OK device all in all, a lot of things annoyed me. Bag of compromises is the best definition of all non-pro Google Pixels. Unreliable fingerprint sensor, pretty weak processor, overheating issues under moderate load (camera, Youtube, bluetooth...), overheating when charging, uninspiring camera hardware and manual controls, bad display visibility under sunlight.

The choice for new phone came down to 14 Ultra, Pixel 9, and iPhone 15 Pro (yes, I've tried iPhones before, exactly three times several years apart, and always ran back to Android very quickly).

I pulled the plug and got myself Xiomi 14 Ultra, secretly praying I won't face the fogging lens issue out of the box. :)

Unboxing experience was great, in an era when every company cuts down the costs under bull**** excuse of being environment friendly. The box is rock solid, and the content is more than welcome.
Most importantly, when I took out and unwrapped the phone, I was in awe, it screamed ""premium"" in hands.

Now about the usage.

Build quality seems great. It's a heavy device, but rightfully so considering that camera bump and everything they packed inside. Case was a nice addition but I don't think it can protect the phone in any heavy-impact situation, so I'll get something else. Probably the case from photography kit.

Software - I'm fine with it. It's more or less MIUI I already knew so nothing new there. Much less bloatware than on my previous Xiaomi phones. It's fast, animations are fluid, and it can only get better from here. Xiaomi, please pretty please, allow us to change icon shape natively in the system, without external themes or icon packs. Thanks.

Display is great. Outdoor visibility is great. It's a bit on reflective side, but I'm fine with that. Not sure what to feel about curved edges. Feels nice, but glass protectors will look ugly on this one.

Hardware config. It's a snappy phone. Everything feels ultra smooth and effortless. I guess it will never run out of ram, or storage. Copying files (flac music files etc) to and from the phone feels lightning fast. Audio output via bluetooth is awesome, a league above Pixel 7, not sure why. I have Sony XM4 earbuds, and CH700n earphones, and they sounded pretty bad paired with Pixel 7. As an (almost) audiophile, it really bothered me, and I thought at one point that my earphones are simply bad. Now they sound awesome.

Camera. Oh boy. As a hobbyist photographer, with several mirrorles Sony's I had in last few years, I, without any doubt, can say this is the best camera system I ever had on any phone. Period. Sure, Pixels and iPhones are great quick-snappers as I like to call them, bringing effortlessness in taking photos to next level. And sure, their AI and computational photography is next level, compensating for meh hardware. But if you know what you're doing, this phone is mind blowing. There's no bad sensor/lense on this phone. I find main camera and 5x telephoto results to be the best. Images are sharp, vibrant, rich, and color science although very different to Pixel for example, is really good. I find it to be much closer to my Sony cameras, than to Pixel/iPhone. Not sure how much REALLY Leica had their hands involved here, but I love the results very much. Indoor shots might seem dark and underexposed sometimes, but a lot of info is preserved and you can compensate for that in post-processing, or directly in pro mode camera settings.
And yes, there's no fogging, and I hope there won't be any. I used it in 30+ degrees celsius, and in sub 10 degress with a lof of humidity and rain outside.

All in all, for now it seems to be the best phone I ever had, and I've had/tried a LOT of flagship phones.

I doubt anyone will read all this sh*t but if you managed to get to the end - congrats! ;)",2024-09-13 20:27:59,69,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1fg4mnc/a_week_with_14_ultra_the_report/,"camera, display",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,3ldi5,0.99
post,1cjvwms,Xiaomi,Disappointed of Xiaomi 14 Ultra camera ,"Yeah... I may be weird but I honestly don't like it so much. Yes the zoom is good, macro is extremely good but basic shots? The 14 ultra really can't take normal shots.

For example when I have to take a picture of myself in the mirror to my Fitness coach the 14 ultra makes me very white & removes all details (I'm more of a brown color)

It fails on normal shots in the forrest for example. The shadows is too high & the picture is very dark and not true to life even tho authentic mode is on. Vibrant makes everything too vibrant and it looks straight up ugly.

Only good thing is the macro with the zoom lenses.",2024-05-04 08:54:24,1,87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1cjvwms/disappointed_of_xiaomi_14_ultra_camera/,camera,Xiaomi 14 Ultra,Mr_Simon_Christensen,0.51
post,1bwsa4w,Xiaomi,Xiaomi 14 Ultra BAD NEWS,"Bad news I had the 14 Ultra I got it when it 1st came out with the photography kit & the Media Pad 6 tablet. I had the phone for about 2 weeks before the 14 Ultra camera module began to rattle. I got in touch with customer services who arranged for SBE, who are their repair people to have a look at the phone. Xiaomi gave me the option of either a repair or a replacement so I chose replacement. SBE found a fault of Assembly Gap step & when I rang customer services to explain what that meant they said it was a manufacturer fault & that they would be sending me a new 14 Ultra. Today I got an email from them telling me that they don't have any 14 Ultras in stock & that I need to send in the 2 promotional items, the photography kit & the Media Pad 6 & then they will issue me with a full refund so that I can go ahead & buy a new Xiaomi 14 Ultra off there website. How bizarre !!!! Hang on I thought they didn't have any in stock ??Well I refused to send in the 2 items & I demanded a new phone, I reminded him of the Consumer Rights Act & that I expected a new phone within 7 days so lets see what happens. Either way I am really disappointed with Xiaomi I have always had their phones from the 11T 12T, 13 & now the 14 Ultra but I'm lost for words as to how they are treating me now.

Update: 10 April 2024 1043am Just received an email from Xiaomi saying that I can either have my old device back or a brand new 14 Ultra, either of which will be available in the next few days. So although it's good news I'm not counting my chickens until I physically have a brand new replacement 14 Ultra in my hand. But I believe we have made progress

  
MAJOR UPDATE 12.04.24 11.16am

Wonders never cease. Just had a knock on the door & it was DHL with a parcel from Xiaomi. They finally managed to get send me out a brand new 14 Ultra. I emailed them last Friday & within a 5 working days they got me my replacement. Ok so now we see if & when & how loud the rattling is. I will stay objective because a lot of you guys have told me it is part & parcel of the OIS so a certain degree of noise is permissible, but where do we draw the line?

Surely Xiaomi can't expect us to be walking around with something that sounds like a bag of marbles but then again I don't expect it to be as quiet as a mouse because the OIS has to move in order to function. So lets see if this time we get a balance between the two. 

Just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone who has shared my post & who has commented & supported me. I've had over 20K views which is amazing for such a small issue, but its not over yet. I will keep you guys updated with rattling levels. Fingers crossed all is well this time around. Thank once again.

The biggest question is, will the Chinese Version work in the USA or should I pay extra and go for the global model? I've heard that the Chinese version of the software is better tuned.

Also, few things that I wanted to know (please share your experience whether you have Chinese, EU, or Global Version):

* Which carriers will work with the Xiaomi 15 Ultra?
* Does Android Auto work? (If not, is there any workaround?)
* Does ""Hey Google"" and ""Circle To Search"" work?
* Will my Galaxy Watch 6 Classic work? If not any workaround?

post,1ge9frx,Xiaomi,"For 650€, Xiaomi 14 or S23 Ultra or...","I'm currently owning a Samsung A54, battery life is getting worse and worse plus the camera is really a one trick poney, really good main camera and selfie cam on sunlight, but the ultrawide is lackluster and macro is unusable, especially coming from a Find X5.

So I have up to 750€
Don't want to spend more
Here are my options:
- Xiaomi 14, 12/512GB (649€)
- Samsung S24, either SD or EX, 8/256GB (599€)
(I would rather go Snapdragon cause the Exynos is only 30€ cheaper)
- Samsung S23 Ultra, 12/512GB (689€)
- OnePlus 12, 16/512 (729€)
- Xiaomi 14T Pro, 12/512 (679€)

My first instinct would have been to go for the S23 Ultra or the S24, but I want second opinions. My usage is on 4G 90% of the time, 6 days per week I have no access to Wi-Fi so I just need something that I know is gonna last without having to carry a power brick everywhere. For cameras I just want to feel some kind of upgrade compared to my A54.

post,1if7kqn,Xiaomi,Change from Xiaomi 12 to Xiaomi 14 Ultra,"Hi there, people of Xiaomi

Recently, my Xiaomi 12's battery is not the best, but I suppose it's expected after 1 year of use (and a friend of mine mentioned that the wireless charge help degraded the battery) but it really bothers me because I love the phone, it's small, purple and great, but I can't go outside asking if I will have enough battery so the phone doesn't die

My question now is: do you think it a good idea to change to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra? I just looked in a store and the device is aproximately $1,150 (a few days ago it was $1,420) so for me it's a nice deal, but at the same time I think if it's a better idea to wait for the 15 Ultra

The main use I'll plan for it is being my personal device and content creation (video and photography). The main issue I have with the 15 Ultra is the camera disposal, it's weird and I really prioritaze the aesthetic of the phone (the main reason I chose the Xiaomi 12 instead of Xiaomi 13/14)

What do you think is the best option here? I appreciate your comments!",2025-02-01 14:35:01,4,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1if7kqn/change_from_xiaomi_12_to_xiaomi_14_ultra/,"camera, battery",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,ManchegoBoi,1.0

post,1btsh6c,Xiaomi,Xiaomi 14 Ultra Global thoughts,"**Updated with pictures/videos - more info**

Phone was returned to Wondamobile. I could not get the lens fogging to stop, not even with a professional grade dehumidifier. I got a full refund. Now I'm considering what to get instead. Anyone wanna buy a Photo Kit?

** Original post **

So I got the Xiaomi 14 Ultra Global version last Wednesday. Current phone is my Huawei P30 Pro, 5 years old on its original battery, so it's not exactly stellar battery life, although it usually lasts a day just fine on normal use.

After a few days with the X14U, here are my thoughts:

**Battery life**
It's not particularly good, considering the size. I mean, latest gen SnapDragon with all its power-saving goodies, a 5000 mAh battery and I can't say it's markedly better than my CURRENT 5 year old 4200mAh battery in the Huawei. I suppose it COULD improve in time, learning habits etc., but I have to admit, I'm disappointed so far.

The crazy fast recharging is cool though.

**Screen**
Well, it's not really that much bigger. But it IS brighter and the 120Hz display is great. Punchy colours in HDR and DV etc. Can't really fault it. Sure, it's not got Samsung's anti-reflexive display, but that's just life. It's an improvement.

**Camera (and camera kit)**
From a technical viewpoint, it should be leaps better. In reality, it's not something that impressed my THAT much. The camera app is pretty cool. Can't really complain much there. A big improvement over the one in my old Huawei.

Using the camera kit is also pretty nice, although the zooming with the zoom dial is very jerky and not smooth at all. But the build in battery is nice to have and the two-stage shutter button I really like.

In daylight, the camera takes great shots. Movie mode is kinda fun too, although it's a shame it's only available in 1080p/30fps. Otherwise video in 4k/8k etc. looks pretty good in daylight as well. But night shots... that's another story.

Now, when I got the P30 Pro five years ago, night shots were pretty out of this world to me. All my previous phones weren't very good at night shots, but the P30 Pro took amazing night shots. Even today, when I take shots of the same thing with the P30 Pro and the X14U, it seems to me that the P30 Pro actually has more detail in its shots. And yes, I'm using the main lens on both phones.

The X14U also takes pretty awful night shots, if you have the camera app on normal photos and take a picture. The P30 Pro was MUCH better at ""detecting"" whether or not it should take a photo in night shot-mode or normal. But I could live with that. When the X14U is set to night shot, the shots are good, but to be honest, they aren't IMPRESSIVE coming from the P30 Pro. See [this comparison](https://imgur.com/a/NcQsmeE).

Now, VIDEOS at night. What the hell is wrong here? When I shoot video at night, [lights look horrible](https://imgur.com/a/7pACLhB). If you do very slow movements, it's almost okay, but try walking and shooting handheld, and lamp post's light will look ""jumpy"" It looks absolutely terrible and makes for pretty much useless night time video. I tried 1080p/4k/8k, 24/30/60fps. All looked terrible. Movie mode as well. I might try the two steady video modes, but isn't that just OIS AND EIS combined? And that's only available in 1080p 30fps. Got to admit, this is really getting close to being a deal-breaker. And speaking of deal-breakers...

**Lens fogging**
Yes, it's a thing. [Very much so](https://imgur.com/a/MuxNoZ2). In my house it's about 22 degrees celcius. I went out, shot some video on the main camera for less than 2 minutes, and the lens fogging started. It was about 8 degrees celcius outside. Before that, I had tried recording 8k for like 4-5 hours on charger, with the sim-tray removed. I think it has made a LITTLE improvement, but the lens fogging is not gone. I'm not sure it will ever go away, and having to return the phone is such a damn hassle. I bought mine with Wonda Mobile and I have taking videos and pictures of the problem which I will mail them, but I can't say I have high hopes (Edit: They seem to recommend I return it, so I suppose there is always that option). I have spoken to people who are on their third X14U and they still have the lens fogging problem. 

**Conclusion**
The night time video I suppose COULD be improved upon via software updates. The battery as well. 

But the lens fogging... that's a hardware defect and something software can't help with. It might be improved by different methods (suggestions are welcome), but so far I don't have high hopes.

At the moment I'm 50/50 on the point of hoping for a refund or just try to sell the phone at a loss.

What about you people? Any tips on how to improve lens fogging? Get better night video?",2024-04-02 07:14:43,19,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1btsh6c/xiaomi_14_ultra_global_thoughts/,"camera, battery, display",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,jacobtf,0.92

post,1clpiyo,Xiaomi,Xiaomi 14 Ultra Global experience in the US (T-Mobile),"Hello all,

I've been considering switching over to the Xiaomi ecosystem of devices, I've already ordered the 6S Pad Pro, but now I've been looking at the 14 Ultra to see if I would consider switching over to it as well.

However, I want to get a good idea of how the 14 Ultra (Global Variant) works here in the states before I make any decisions. From my research, being a T-Mobile user in mind, it appears the global unit has only a few bands (2, 4, 5, 66, 41) and is missing the bands that T-Mobile usually has in rural areas like 71 and 12 and 25 (both in my area). I have 2 and 41 but they aren't as strong as 71 and 12 and I'm often on 71 the most.

For those who have T-Mobile like myself, is it pretty functional for you all? Or do I probably need to avoid this one.

post,1gfetto,Xiaomi,"New to android and got the xiaomi 14 ultra, need help!","Ok so here's the thing. I'm blown away by how good this phone is, so I want to keep it, but there are some things that I'm simply not able to figure out and need help. 

1. Airdrop: I have a Mac laptop and my wife an iphone, how do I send files to and from? Bluetooth worked ONCE from my laptop, now it always fails. And with my wife's iphone we have tried ar least 5 applications and none of them work.
2. Keyboard: it's a mess. I speak and write 5 languages and the bottom line where the number button, the comma, the space and emoji buttons are got added an earth logo to change languages from (even though I can also change by long pressing the keyboard), this made the emoji and comma button become one so every time I want to put an emoji I have to long press the comma button, extremely annoying. 
3. Data usage: on iphones, you can go to the settings section and individually decide which apps can use mobile data and which not. I spent 15 minutes on this yesterday but couldn't find any info anywhere... 
4. Widgets: how do I put app widgets on the lock screen to be able to just tap on it and immediately unlock and open the app? I had this option on an iphone. Makes using it SO much faster.  
5. Locked screen: on an iphone when I tap the screen with my finger (anywhere on the screen), it lights up and I can see the notifications, to do this on my xiaomi I'm having to press the lock button, if I only tap the screen it lights up to show me the fingerprint button and the time only...

I have many more questions, but maybe there's a good Xiaomi android guide someone out there knows about. These are definitely my main points though, especially the airdrop situation...

post,1cjl2i0,Xiaomi,Suggestion between a Xiaomi 14 Ultra / Canon 6D,"Hello everyone,



For starters, consider me a complete newbie in the matter. 

I've been thinking for quite some time to get a Canon 6d, however I feel like smartphone cameras are getting quite good, even though, even me being a newbie, know they are not close and most likely they'll never reach the same quality, of course. 

Considering all this, there's been a new smartphone which recently came out, the xiaomi 14 ultra, that even has a photography kit, which transforms the phone into a camera of sorts. 

Considering I've never had a camera before, I've been having some thoughts about buying the camera, mainly because of the Portability. 

The xiaomi 14 ultra is, REPORTEDLY, pretty good, and even has a variable aperture. 

I have to buy a new phone now, and I was looking at this one, and I think it's a pretty good idea to start on photography and I would like to know your opinions. 

I think I have to speak of money as well, because the xiaomi 14 ultra with the photography kit is 1500 EUR, and the Canon 6d I was going to buy would be with a 85mm, 24-70mm, those options.

So I could either buy the regular xiaomi 14 + camera or only the ultra. 

I would like to know your opinions, all of them, considering the smartphone and the camera if possible.

I'm interested in the update status of Xiaomi. Does it improve the camera? Does it enhance with any new features?

Looking at the pictures taken by Xiaomi 14 Ultra, they are fantastic, but when I compare them to some other phones, there's a huge difference, like comparing a flagship model to a midrange one. (Check out the comparison between Xiaomi 14 Ultra vs Vivo X100 Pro).

So, I'm curious if Xiaomi improves and enhances the camera with updates? Because there's certainly software potential to make it one of the best cameras.

Or do you think the camera software will remain the same quality as it is now? (Give some examples you've noticed).

Here's the thing, I've spent the last couple of months dead set on getting a Xiaomi 14. I wanted the Pro model, but I live in Europe and Android Auto wouldn't work, so I've settled for the smaller screen size. The Ultra will be coming to Europe, but that's the ugliest phone I've ever seen, so it's a hard pass for me.

I've done my research and the 14 offers pretty much everything I need in a phone. But...

Yesterday, after I've ordered the Xiaomi, my SO decided she wants one for herself. I was ready to order another when I found out that I can get a Magic 6 Pro for a similar price. Ok, it's not that similar, but it's managable.

I've never really concidered the Honor. Actually, I completely forgot there was a 6 Pro coming out, I'm only aware of the 5 Pro. I've owned a couple of Xiaomi phones and I really like them. I also love Huawei phones (currently own a Mate 20 Pro, a P30 Pro and a Nova 5T). I know Honor phones are similar to Huawei and that's the reason for my dilemma.

Let's forget about the price difference, the display size difference and the battery size difference...

post,1efu2vp,Xiaomi,Scratches on My New Xiaomi 14 Ultra Screen – Is This Normal?,"Hey Xiaomi Community,

I recently bought a Xiaomi 14 Ultra and, while I'm loving the phone's performance and features, I've run into a bit of an issue that I'm hoping to get some advice on.

A few days ago, I used the reverse wireless charging feature with a friend's device and placed my phone face down on a table at McDonald's. I thought the table would be safe for the screen, but to my surprise, I noticed several scratches on the display afterwards. Given how expensive and supposedly durable the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is, I'm pretty concerned.

For context, I removed the original plastic protection from the screen right after purchase because I'm always very careful with my devices and have never felt the need to use screen protectors, especially with a phone that's supposed to be scratch-resistant.

Is it normal for the Xiaomi 14 Ultra's screen to get scratched this easily? Could this be a defect in the coating process or the materials used?

Has anyone else experienced something similar, or can anyone provide guidance on what to do next? Should I reach out to Xiaomi support?

Thanks in advance for any advice or insights!",2024-07-30 14:00:10,1,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1efu2vp/scratches_on_my_new_xiaomi_14_ultra_screen_is/,"display, performance",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,laurienzu,0.57
post,1bk7lxg,Xiaomi,Help with case for Xiaomi 14 Ultra,"Hello everyone

SeI'm writing this post because I needed to ask a question. I recently received my xiaomi 14 Ultra, although it brings the basic cover and still has the case that comes with the photographic kit, I wanted to buy a case that would also protect the lenses and so I thought about getting one of Nillkin's cases

However, I found myself in doubt. The most basic hood that protects the lens also ( 1 ) seems to be slippery and difficult to grip, can anyone who has this type of hood tell you how it feels to wear it? 

I was undecided between this ( 1 ) and this one ( 2 ) , which one do you advise? 

Thanks for your time and help.

post,1dmnc83,Xiaomi,Vivo x100 Pro vs Xiaomi 14 Ultra ,"Hi guys, first of all I should mention that I already had both phones for about week, but my issue is, that I don't decide which one to choose as my daily driver.
I already try all flagsihps available in my region (in global version with local warranty) expect Sony Xperia for which I still waiting for my pre-order one, and for now I narrow my choice only on x100 Pro and 14 Ultra.

Both phones was really good and both of them had small issues but nothing what I can't live with.

What I can't test was the experience with long-term usage, and that's why I want to ask you, mainly users which have experience with Vivo (funtouch) or Xiaomi (global) devices, how is software support, speed of updates etc?

Also how is battery degradation after some time? I had experience from Samsung that after less than 2 years battery is really weak.

And how is build quality after time? I know that there are each year newer ""more resistent"" materials used on phones, but how is resistance agains scratches on display/back panel? Especially that ""leather"" finish ones. 
I use my phone without cases or screen protector for many years and for past models I have issues only with scratches on alluminium frame.

And one more question for x100 Pro and 14 Ultra users, I made more than 1000 photos from both devices, but somehow I totally forgot or don't have chance to try capture some motion shot, how this phones hande motion? For example runnign dogs, kids playing, or some shot from evening events with peoples in different condition inside/outside?

Currently both phones are in my country on same price (about 1050€) or there is also option for Xiaomi 14 Ultra with photohraphy kit and wireless charger for 1199€, so it is not like few months ago when Vivo was for 1100 and Xiaomi for 1500.
Also I want to keep phone for at least next 3 years

post,1djs1g2,Xiaomi,Xiaomi Mi 14 ultra hyperos security flaw ,"I have discovered a significant security flaw in the Xiaomi Mi 14 Ultra HyperOS related to the Ultra Battery Saver mode. I use a security app called Cerberus, which protects your device from being turned off, takes pictures when someone tries to unlock your device with the wrong code, and can trigger an alarm with a message that can't be turned off when stolen. 

While this app works well on the Xiaomi, turning on Ultra Battery Saver mode—or having the device automatically enter this mode when the battery reaches 1%—disables all security features, including Cerberus, the ""OK Google"" assistant, and Google Pay. Additionally, when the device is recharged, you must manually re-enable all these settings. 

Xiaomi needs to address this issue and not force the system to choose Ultra Battery Saver mode when the battery is extremely low. This vulnerability means that thieves can simply wait for the device to die and then reset it, bypassing all security measures. These devices cost a lot, Xiaomi should at least try because on Huawei & Samsung there is not issues whatsoever ",2024-06-19 19:40:51,0,15,https://www.mi.com/global/hyperos,battery,Xiaomi 14 Ultra,Ukrainemustwin,0.25
post,1disx47,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi 14 Ultra, my first and last Xiaomi phone ","First and foremost, lack of updates for the global version is my biggest deal breaker. Bought the device on day one, had 3 software updates in total, 2 of which were security updates and one didn't specify what it was about.
Let me start with the camera. Anything that doesn't have a human subject in it, this device will give you STUNNING results, something that people won't believe it was taken by a smartphone. But the moment you start taking pictures of people, the color science falls apart, skin tones becomes washed out, colors around the main subject becomes either super flat, or oversaturated with a heavy contrast applied, especially if there's greenery in the background. Be it using the authentic or vivid mode, the picture quality is awful 6 times out of 10.
And I wish my issues with the 14 Ultra stopped here. I can never understand the reasons behind some of the decisions Xiaomi take that make their software this terrible. For example, why is the Gallery stuck on one screen color mode? Why is it that if I changed my phone's colors to vibrant or saturated, the gallery will still be in the default natural mode?
Or how about the dialer and contacts? Why are they forcing majority of markets to use the Google apps instead of their own dialer app? At least give us the option to download it and set it as default.
Then there is the iOS like notification bar, it's limited and frustrating for those who have been used to how notification bars and gestures are on Androids.

I can name few more, yes I'm nitpicking, but one minor issue here and another there, and you'll end up getting reminded by how frustrating their software is.
To make matters worse, I have submitted countless of feedbacks, including links to dozens of threads, posts and videos, of people complaining about these issues, and they always promise me they will get fixed with the next update, and again, pardon me for repeating myself, but here comes my biggest issue with Xiaomi, their lack of UPDATES! It's the reason why this will be my first and last Xiaomi phone.

I'm searching wireless car charger for Xiaomi 14 Ultra (80W preferably)

For now Xiaomi provides only 50W one:

I'm even not sure if it's compatible(with camera island and coil position) and if X14U will utilize 50W at all
I know it had some problems with previous Xiaomi wireless chargers, because position of coil has changed. At least people stated that for this charger:

post,1an1qp4,Xiaomi,"Xiaomi 13 Pro or Ultra, or Xiaomi 14?","Xiaomi 13 Pro or Ultra - Buy now or wait?

I am looking for a phone with two physical sim card slots, a good camera and 5G band support, including the dominant 5G bands in the USA (n41/n71/n258/n260/n261 or n2/n5/n77/n258/n260/n261)

I have been (happily) using a Huawei P20 Pro for the last several years. Unfortunately that phone has started to have some screen issues on very cold days (screen not turning on), and it obviously has no 5G bands. 

I use the camera a lot, so I was looking at the Xiaomi 13 Ultra as a replacement, but noticed that it is missing certain bands (N71) that the 13 pro has. Neither supports n200+ bands, so that isn't really a factor. 

The other concern being that ATT has randomly blacklisted non-carrier approved phones, so switching carries for better coverage isn't the best option, as the phone might not work... So I would be relying solely on n41 signal availability for 5G. 

The 13 pro would still be an upgrade over my P20 Pro, but I really would like the better camera of the Ultra. 

Does it make sense to get either the 13 Pro or Ultra now, or would it be a better idea to wait until the Xiaomi 14 Pro / Ultra are out in the hope that the missing 5G bands are included in those models?

Any thoughts, advise or suggestions are welcome, especially from those that have used either one of these phones in the US and can provide insight into signal strength and availability. 

I am also open to other phone suggestions, but Samsung / Apple are pretty much out due to only offering 1 e-sim and 1 physical sim slot in their US phones.",2024-02-09 23:20:30,2,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1an1qp4/xiaomi_13_pro_or_ultra_or_xiaomi_14/,camera,Xiaomi 14 Ultra,Careless-Ad1704,1.0

post,1f3h2qk,Xiaomi,Xiaomi 14 Ultra Camera Going Haywire,"I have no idea what is happening with my X14U cameras. Sometimes they work normally but I think when the phone starts to get a bit warm, the cameras just go haywire. Not sure how else to describe it. The image flips upside down, colors get inverted, two main cameras start making a lot of noise due to aperture opening/closing & IOS causing camera lens to jitter like crazy, and many features such as Night mode, Pro mode, Video mode, etc. just outright stop working. The actual camera app controls seem to work fine, but the EVF image freezes.

post,1ciaqc5,Xiaomi,Photography Kit grip xiaomi 14 Ultra useless ?? No AE/AF lock on half press ??,"Camera phones as standard have continuous focusing when you open the camera app and will focus on whatever is in the middle of the frame, normal behaviour. 
Now with any camera (or phone) that has a shutter button (half press button that is) this behaviour can be changed to lock exposure and focus (AE AF) to allow for let's say focusing on a subject and recompose the picture without losing the focus.

But here the photo grip half press is useless since it just does continuous focusing, so what's the point of having a half press shutter ? With or without the grip you end up having to lock exposure by tap hold screen, making the grip basically irrelevant in the first place !

Am I missing something here ? I spent the good part of a day looking for the option to lock AE/AF to no avail... Contacted Xiaomi but never got a reply !!

Let's say I want to take a photo of person at a bus stop and wait for a bus to go past to see the person through that bus window, with AE/AF it will keep focus and exposure on the subject until you release the half press button or take the photo but currently it will shift it's focus to the bus and the actual subject will be blurry... 

I don't know, seems to me to be a major oversight which again makes the use of this grip redundant.

Anyone noticed this too ? I was so hyped about being able to use this grip but now am very underwhelmed !",2024-05-02 08:45:25,4,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1ciaqc5/photography_kit_grip_xiaomi_14_ultra_useless_no/,camera,Xiaomi 14 Ultra,--sebseb--,1.0

post,1df79qk,Xiaomi,Questions regarding focus and supermacro mode on 14 Ultra,"Hi

I come from the Xperia 1 V.
There (and also with ""real"" cameras) the focus square changes to green when the shutter button is half-pressed and wheb the object is in focus. It stays white (or red) if the camera can't focus. 
Is this really not the case with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra with Photo Kit?
That would be very practical as a visual help, especially for macros... because if I'm too close, of course it can't focus.

And another question:
What's the difference between the ""normal"" mode with the 75mm lens (3.2x) and the Supermacro mode? In ""normal"" mode with 75mm I can take macro shots just as well?

post,1b83she,Xiaomi,Xiaomi 13/14 Ultra backless bumpers,"Are there any bumpers for the 14 Ultra (or were there for the 13 ultra) that have no back?  If I buy a beautiful expensive phone, I don't want to immediately cover up half of it.

I currently have a Huawei P30 pro.  I needed case for two reasons.  It was so slippery, it would literally slide down in my hand unless I gripped it very tightly.  I didn't want the camera bump hitting the table every time I put the phone down.  I bought the [Rhinoshield Crashguard](https://rhinoshield.io/pages/crashguard-nx) bumper.  It was just a ring around the edges of the phone and it left the back open.  The top and bottom were raised enough that the camera bump and screen would never touch the table.  Yet the sides were thin so I couldn't feel it.  This is the kind of thing I'm looking for.

The 13/14 Ultra has the leather back and less curved screen so maybe the phone is not as slippery.  But I think I still need some protection. I still assume that if I dropped it onto concrete on a corner, it would leave a mark on the phone at minimum.  They also have the huge camera bump.  A little less in the 14 ultra. I don't want to be hitting the edge of the ring every time I put down the phone.  That feels like it would be bad for the phone.  I wonder if there is some sort of ring that can go around it to protect it.  like the lens cap on the photography kit.  Or a rubberband like thing.  Ofcouse being round, I guess the phone will want to tend to roll a bit.  I could ofcourse put the phone down the other way, but in that case, I still want something raised to protect the screen.  Sometimes I want to put down the phone so I can see the screen.

I'm curious if others have found solutions that give some protection while not covering up the whole phone",2024-03-06 16:19:24,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1b83she/xiaomi_1314_ultra_backless_bumpers/,camera,Xiaomi 14 Ultra,eng33,0.67

use the phone as a pallet when writing or drawing on the tab

putting the devices side by side and forming a connection that will allow me to drag and drop files from one device to the other. I can also use the connected keyboar to move between the devices.

if i take pics on my phone, a hard copy can automatically transfer to my tab.

Is any of this possible with Xiaomi and are there features that Xiaomi can do, that Samsung devices can't do (as far working with one another)?

Pros:
- The device is insane in terms of performance, in some task it beat most of flagships.
- The camera is awesome, best I have personally seen on Xiaomi (I know there are better camera in 14 and 14 ultra) but this camera is great for many things
- Camera is good for taking photos at night time
- Bit smaller than 13T (I like compact devices)
- Played PUBG on high settings, device got heated but when I played in AC room, it was okay, frame rate was stable
- Thankfully no jitter in video recording like 13T

Cons:
- The only con I have noticed yet is the battery, it good but no very good. I think it can be better with some software updates.

post,1gp1sdg,Xiaomi,"Rant: After a decade, I moved from Xiaomi","Title. I still don't know how to feel about it. I guess I was just blind for a long time.

Back in the day, I was amongst the first in Europe to review Xiaomi Mi 2 for one of the largest Android-focused webmags in Czechia. Ever since then, I have loved Xiaomi. I was expecting their new models, hopping on their flagship trains. Some software issues? They were not as important to me because their phones were performing well overall: Xiaomi Mi 2, Mix 2, Mi9, Mi10T, 13, and lastly, 14 Ultra. And surprisingly, it was 14 Ultra that broke my neck for me.

Great cameras. I really loved the Leica collaboration—the pics had a soul out of the phone. No editing was needed. But as my phone needs moved from cameras and media consumption towards productivity, Xiaomi failed big times—and not just by HyperOS features.

Ever since one of the last updates, I've seen problems with my Bluetooth (just in making calls - the other side heard me cutting), deformed notifications, and most importantly, navigating the system with gestures became impossible. In several apps gesture back just stopped working. The amount of thumbs-ups, uncalled-for replies, and misclicked sent e-mails was just too much for me to handle. Especially when I'm dealing in business deals worth millions of euros (energy sector). Sometimes, it just put a bad light on me.

And no - doing factory reset on a phone that cost me 1400€ in pre-order is not an option. The phone for that amount of money should do its absolutely basic job flawlessly. Hell, everyone can do system navigation and notifications flawlessly nowadays, even no-name brands from China. So what the hell is wrong with you, Xiaomi?

14 Ultra being the radiator it is with poor battery life are still acceptable drawbacks for having that sweet camera. But you have to be able to navigate it in the first place.

So after a long time of consideration, I've decided to switch to a competing brand that was my option #2 when deciding about my new flagship phone (#1 was 14 Ultra at the time). And I'm stunned at what I was missing out on until now.

Flawless navigation, with hand gestures and eye control? What? And it works flawlessly? Amazing desktop mode, where I will try to replace my laptop for work? FUNCTIONING VoLTE, VoWiFi, RCS? e-SIM? Incredible multitasking options directly on the phone, with floating windows, actually working ""AI"" copy and paste? Really good set of cameras (didn't like the reviews of the cam and didn't trust Dxo, but they look really nice right now)? And it was WAY cheaper back then when I was buying 14 Ultra?

I just feel dumb at this point. HyperOS in its global installment is an absolute piece of garbage. It was a big step up from MiUi, for sure. But holy moly, is Xiaomi absolutely terrible and behind the competition in the software space.

I'm really glad I managed to get enough money to buy the second phone for more or less the same price as I got from the guy who bought 14 Ultra from me. It just cost me a phone, a photography kit, and a wireless 80W charger (those two were thankfully for ""free"" with pre-order. Doesn't matter they dropped the price of the phone right after the campaign. Money lost, nerves wrecked from the past 2 months, missing Leica a lot, but damn. The software elsewhere is just light-years away.

P.S.: Also, what the hell is wrong with their pricing? You literally buy the phone and a month later is for 20 % off. They are the 2nd largest phone manufacturer in the world. The Xiaomi days, Xiaomi Summer, Xiaomi 11.11. or whatever in here just kills the resell value of the phones. You lose 50 % of the phone value the day you purchase the phone. And it's not because it's Chinese. Hell, OnePlus, Vivo, Honor, Motorola - they all, more or less, stick to their value.

Have you ever had similar enlightenment? Were you absolutely bamboozled at how you could've lived with Xiaomi for so long after switching to **literally anything** else?",2024-11-11 20:10:07,49,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1gp1sdg/rant_after_a_decade_i_moved_from_xiaomi/,"camera, battery, price",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,Kovmen,0.78

post,1hu30mz,Xiaomi,I don't take back anything I said. ,"Hi all, in my previous post here I simplified things to make it easier to understand but I think that caused me to leave out important details so here's the full story. I used to own a Xiaomi note 10 pro max, within a year the battery was degraded and a full charge lasted half the time that it used to (this is an issue on cheaper xiaomi phones, their batteries are trash), eventually that phone broke and I needed a replacement. I went to find a decent phone and there were no options under 400 dollars (I'm in South Africa so tech is pricey here), I eventually found a used mi 11 ultra on marketplace that was advertised as the global version. When I got the phone I noticed that many of the functions weren't working and it was 2 years behind on updates. I tried to update it and that's when it bricked, at first I restarted it and it worked but then after another restart it never worked. My guess at that stage was that the phone was bought from AliExpress, the phones on AliExpress are China versions with global firmware flashed on. I confirmed that the phone was Chinese, for the record I could not check the phone beforehand since I had it delivered to my house because the person was 1400km away from my house. I tried to unlock the bootloader but that couldn't work since the phone was stuck on a screen no matter what I did, this only started happening over the 4th restart which is extremely strange. Eventually I called xiaomi after exhausting most options and they pretty much told me that it's not their problem. I took it to their only repair center in the entire country but they only do hardware. I then took it to someone I know who owns a repair store, I told him that I think edl should fix it. EDL is emergency Download Mode, it requires that you disassemble the phone and short 2 pins, it's a backup incase the primary bootloader is corrupted. He managed to fix it via EDL but I had already bought a replacement by then. I am still a xiaomi fan but I don't think I'll buy another xiaomi phone soon, I love what xiaomi is doing with their cars and their other products but the software seems like it has deep flaws underneath the surface, you know what they say about building houses on sand. The mi 11 ultra was fine for the short while that it worked, the camera was decent, the battery lasted a day which is okay, the performance was reasonable and the charging was quick however it had various issues such as serious overheating problems, a somewhat laggy user experience, oled burn it which is normal I suppose and other issues that made the phone feel cheap. My experience with the redmi note 10 pro max was good other than the battery issues however I did also have software issues on that phone that xiaomi took a year to fix. I'm way happier with my Huawei Pura 70 pro, I have no doubt that the mi 14 ultra is faster but the experience on this phone is unmatched compared to everything else I've used and I've used most phones. When xiaomi starts giving customer support, makes edl easily accessible, makes unlocking the bootloader possible and fixes some of their issues I will support them. There are other notable issues on the mi 11 ultra such as the wifi chip overheating and desoldering itself from the mother board. I must note that I've compared my Pura 70 pro to a mi12s ultra, s24 ultra, iPhone 16 pro, iPhone 15 pro max, s23 ultra, mi 14 ultra and more and the Huawei camera wins in my humble opinion. I had a bad experience, it seems relatively common. It isn't xiaomis fault, if anything it's the AliExpress seller who flashed global firmware but the way xiaomi has the bootloader access and edl mode setup makes it almost impossible to repair, I blame them for that 100%, it should be very different.

post,1bs67ou,Xiaomi,Xiaomi long term support,"Hi all!

After a few years with Apple and Samsung, I decided to go on with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra since I really care about the camera and my S24U, despite being a great smartphone, has very bad cameras.


Now, selling the S24U and buying the X14U means losing some money in the middle, plus moving on a brand that I don't know since a few years (my last Xiaomi was Mi 10).


I gotta admit, I am pretty happy with Samsung, their customer service (in Germany at least) is pretty good, almost every company has discount on latest devices and, again, I find the S24U a great device for many reasons (OneUI customization and features, spen, dex, etc).


As long term Xiaomi users, are you happy with the brand? 

I mean in terms of updates, features that come to older models, customer service (at least in Europe, even better Germany), etc?

The X14U is great, I know that, I am just concernd from the fact that Xiaomi is a Chinese company and therefore many features, accessories, covers, whatever are released in China but not here.

For a non-wear OS, basic system device, it seemed packed with features, and checking online reviews it seems its sensors are pretty accurate.

Well, here I am, one month later, and now I have a Smart Band 9, and I sold my Pixel Watch few days ago. While I also loved the elegant design of Pixel Watch, it had its share of shortcomings.Its battery was terrible, charging was ultra slow, and system in general felt very laggy - and in the end, I never used any benefits of a full-fledged OS like wearOS. I used it to track my steps, my running sessions, and to have notifications on my wrist.
I love how this band looks on wrist, I love the wide variety of awesome faces, I love plenty of functions packed inside for a ""budget"" fitness band.

The only thing I'll miss is that built in gps, but it's not a big deal in the end, I'll run with my phone.

To get back to my question - how this thing costs only $50? Now I see all the hype, and why it's one of the bestselling wearables ever.

I ditched my Pixel 7 for Xiaomi 14 Ultra.
I ditched my Pixel Watch for Smart Band 9.
I got myself a Xiaomi scooter.

It's like a certain pattern emerges here! :D

post,1d39gym,Xiaomi,Xiaomi is really a step behind when the topic is Windows integration,"This year I switched my old device (OPPO A53s) for a Poco F5. My old device was physically damaged and was too expensive to repair + it was already a weak device in terms of hardware back in his day and it even got worse with time. I switched to the F5 because it was really a bargain for the hardware it has (I play Brawl Stars and the phone is outstanding in gaming for what it cost me). But there is one thing I'm missing: integration with Windows. OPPO and Samsung are really great with it, because through Phone Link I could access any file in my device and copying it to my laptop without connecting cables and even in Samsung devices you can use some apps through your PC screen. But the biggest thing I miss is the Clipboard sync with SwiftKey.

This for me to ask: why are other Android manufacturers working with Microsoft to make the Android-Windows experience better, but Xiaomi (and Google) are appearently ignoring it and working only in their envoirments? Xiaomi does not even have any easily buyable laptop/PC and Windows Phone died years ago, so I think Xiaomi is standing behind the competition in this aspect. Integration with other platforms is going to be a big challenge for Android in the next years, since Apple already has an estabilished ecossystem where all devices work perfectly with each other (and I'm not an Apple fanboy or smth like that)

 - Xiaomi 14 Ultra
 - Oppo Find X7 Ultra
 - Vivo X100 Pro

I really like Xiaomi 14 Ultra camera specs on paper and I'm big fan of camera photography kit.

but there are several issues with this phone:

 - lens fogging
 - unbalanced weight(camera section is very heavy, so easy to drop out)
 - one big unprotected glass over camera section
 - poor night photography(especially how EIS makes video stuttering, when you are walking and recording:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1btsh6c/xiaomi_14_ultra_global_thoughts/


One of the biggest concerns about smartphones is how front display is fragile.
But in case of all this 'camera-replacement' marketed phones we got similar fragility of really big circular piece of glass on the back, done probably only to mimics 'camera' visually.

I really like durable hardware and plan to use my smartphone for years, so beside camera performance durability is second factor.

And I'm really wondering if shouldn't I buy Samsung 24 Ultra. Beside having 7years of upgrades, embedded stylus, rectangular screen I really appreciate it's premium and comfortable metal back, with protruding small metal rings, covering small lens glass covers. It's way better solution than what all this 'camera' smartphones provides.

I know SG24U don't like moving object and has 0.5s shutter lag...

And that circular big glass lens covers allows using photographic filters...but there are also 3rd party adapters for other phones (even for non-circular, like Samsung)...and often they also allow using 3rd party lenses(providing bigger zoom)


So I'm really torned between buying Xiaomi 14 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy 24 Ultra, waiting for Vivo X100 Pro+ (if '+' version will be released at all)...
 
or
 
...fixing one of mine current shitty phones and buying some decent(or fixing current one) compact camera or DSLR and waiting another year for Xiaomi 15 Ultra (hopefully without fogging and maybe dual telescopic), SG25U or even something more exciting.


I'm open to suggestions, but I live in EU, so  B20 band/android auto may be useful (so Oppo Find X7 Ultra with it's dual telescoping cameras, may be not the best choice in my case)",2024-04-07 22:19:49,4,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1byh8dt/i_personally_think_that_sg24u_small_glass/,"camera, display, performance",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,UnixWarrior,0.83
post,1ercoou,Xiaomi,Mi 13 ultra sim radio off? ,"Good afternoon everyone,

I've been happily using my Xiaomi Mi 13 ultra for just over a year now. 
I generally run 2 sims concurrently. Both 5g sims, both from the same provider, AIS, in Thailand.
Yesterday, I got caught in Noah's biblical rain and was soaked to the bone. 
The phone was functioning normally after I got inside and dried off. 
I then used the IR blaster as a remote to adjust the air conditioning in my hotel room and the phone did a self hard reboot. 
Now, neither sim is receiving any signal. 
The cards are recognized and the numbers show up in the settings. I can read the IMEI numbers etc. However, no bars of service. 
I have put it into and out of airplane mode. I have activated and deactivated mobile data. I have rebooted. I have pulled the cards, added them back one at a time, in both slots. I have updated to HYPEROS 1.0.12.0.umacnxm. 
I have used *#*#3646#*#* and manually turned on the radio. 
None of these have worked. I now have a Walkman and a camera in my pocket rather than a data connected life machine. 

Has anyone else had this issue and if so, have you ever been able to fix it?

The complication here is that while I now live in Thailand, I bought the phone while I lived in Shanghai. And this model is not sold here in Thailand. The 13t and the 14 is sold here but not the 13 ultra.

i got my 13 ultra about a month ago. the camera is good on it... when it wants to be good. my problem is that auto HDR barely ever kicks in. this is especially annoying if i want to take a pic of my monitor, either i have to drop the exposure to the lowest possible and make it look like i'm in a dark room, or use my 12 pro which has the option to force HDR. this issue also prevails when there are some smaller windows. i can take a pic on my 12 pro and with HDR forced, you can see stuff outside the windows clearly, but the 13 ultra just overblows it. 

my biggest disappointment with it is that there is either auto HDR (which barely even works) or off, no forced HDR like on my 12 pro. is there any way to force HDR to be on? i'm willing to use gcam given someone can provide a sane config+apk or a place to look for it. i already tried flashing an older version of leica cam, but those didn't recognise my telephoto lenses and also didn't have force HDR for some reason.

Survived me a trip to Sydney and Sicily and glad I discovered this. Saves us the grief of crying over no esim functionality in the Global option. In fact, I'm typing this on my purchased esim right now.

When i try doing photos in low light, i noticed that the camera is having a hard time getting the details done. The camera on my phone even had trouble capturing the light show at a concert.

post,1hekpsw,Xiaomi,14T A Worthy Upgrade?,"So I have been with Xiaomi for a while. My Last phone being the K50 Pro (yes an overseas Model) which I have been using for a few years now. I am not too concerned with regular use or the camera features, but I do want to see if I should stick to the Brand with more local models (13T to 14T models)

So I wanted to ask if it's more worthy to stick with Xiaomi with an upgrade. The reason why I wanted to is because I am starting to see issues with the screen after months of intermittent charging alerts When I am not even plugged in to a Power source. And since we are in a year end sale, I thought might as well ask the question.

I have a few things I am worried about. First is the mobile Internet, which is a problem for a while. I have come across less than Great Service areas where my Internet would cut out and not work. I was wondering if the same happens to the newer models.

Another one I'm worried about is the gaming side. I notice that the regular 14T have a Dimensity 8300 Ultra Model. As someone who used the K50 Pro with the Dimensity 9000, I was wondering if it will affect my gaming experience. Not to mention At this time, I have a little difficulty with 3D settings with certain elements ending up flickering During the experience.

I don't know if there's any other concerns, But if there's anything that I can think up of, I'll ask again.",2024-12-15 04:17:42,3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1hekpsw/14t_a_worthy_upgrade/,camera,14 Ultra,DolphinSquared,1.0

post,1gtrlyp,Xiaomi,Fix/Workaround broken Super Wallpapers,"Maybe you have the same problem as me on my Xiaomi 13T that the super wallpapers no longer work. At least for me, none of them work except for the geometry ones, they just freeze. I found a workaround so that you can use them again.

1. Uninstall your Super Wallpaper.

2. Download an old APK of your desired super wallpaper from the Internet, e.g. from apkmirror. Use a version from 2023 or older, it doesn't really matter. Just don't use a new one, because they don't work.

3. Turn off the internet connection on your device.

4. Install the downloaded APK.

5. Set the wallpaper as usual in the wallpaper settings.

6. Turn the Internet back on. Done.


We have to turn off the Internet before installation because the system automatically checks for updates and then won't let us set the old version as the background because it wants to update. But if it is set as the background, the old version works normally even if it found an update.

But turn off automatic updates for system apps in the system settings, otherwise you will get the broken new version again!

I hope I could help you. All the best guys!",2024-11-18 00:05:47,11,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1gtrlyp/fixworkaround_broken_super_wallpapers/,none,14 Ultra,Ok-Height9300,0.92

post,1hwgz05,smartphones,Xiaomi 14 vs iPhone 14 (Photography vs Videography),"Hi! I'm looking to buy a new phone, not interested in flagship, just want decent overall features with the main focus being the phone's camera. 

I can afford either of these two base versions and not their ultra or pro ones, and it's been tough to decide because:

a) From as many online comparisons as I could see, it's been evident that both have almost the same photo and video quality (the photos in xiaomi although, have greater depth at shadows which sometimes looks better; and the videos in iPhone obviously offer greater stabilization).

b) I intend to shoot cinematic videos so I need the stabilization and high quality record ability with minimal grain and good light detection by the sensor (I don't know which phone's sensor offers better results in that case).

c) Along with that, my main use will be photography too for which I'll need shutter speed, iso and focus control too which does not come with iPhone's main camera app but I've seen people recommend/use 3rd party camera apps which have the pro mode (as present in Xiaomi). But I'm confused — which app is better in that case and does it preserve the photo quality.

d) They are at the same price where I live with the Xiaomi offering 12gb ram and 512gb storage and iPhone offering 8gb ram and 128gb storage (which is a pretty huge difference but I also have a spare hard disk so storage isn't a deciding factor for me if the camera isn't upto the mark).

For context, I've had the Samsung M31 for 4 years now, and it works fine but over processes pictures with its normal camera and has much lower quality obviously, it also does not have a video pro mode but the photo pro mode has gained me some amazing photos (not to mention this is the phone on which I started and learned all that I know about photography).

I've checked out the specs to my knowledge and the comparisons but the above points stop me from deciding what to purchase.

post,1d3bg2q,smartphones,Xiaomi 14 ultra vs Honor Magic 6 pro,"Hello. I'm going for an upgrade from Redmi Note 11 pro and after I narrowed down my choices, it boils down to either Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Honor Magic 6 pro. I want to be sure as their price are no joke.

Im my country, they almost have identical prices with xiaomi being more expensive by 35$ which is minimal at their price point for me. So please disregard the pricing.

One thing I consider is the camera. What I'm finding is the one who produces the better selfie, portrait and scenery photos both in day and night modes. I don't care which would produce the closer color to authentic mode as I would definitely post something that I look better. As for videos, I don't do record much.

Next is battery, which of the two in the long run would end in better condition? Their sites don't provide extensive battery protection features so I'm at a loss on these two.

Next is the OS. Which will assist you better in daily tasks, boast more features and is more convenient to use? I don't mind the complexity of use as long as it will feel more convenient once set. I don't have experience with the Honor's OS so I can't compare.

Lastly the warranty, any experience on claiming, which brand will provide better customer service with the two. I don't have issues yet with my phone so I didn't experience xiaomi's warranty service fortunately.

Any insights are greatly appreciated. Please help me choose between the two.

I've been using the Samsung S24 Ultra since its launch and it's been great, but recently, the battery on my phone has deteriorated. I now have to charge my phone at least twice a day to get through the day. On average, I get around 8-9 hours of screen-on time (SOT) throughout the day, which means I have to charge my phone twice a day.
I purchased a Xiaomi 14 Ultra back in March, but I sold it because it had a lot of heating issues and battery drain problems.
I recently bought another Xiaomi 14 Ultra just 2 days ago, and apparently the phone received an update that fixed most of the issues. Now, I can easily get 7 hours of SOT on a single charge, according to my usage, and the phone doesn't heat up much even when using the cameras. Samsung has not released the June update in India yet, so I'm unsure if that update will fix the battery issue or not.

Where I live, the price difference of these phones are about $200.

I also considered the Pixel lineup, but I’m avoiding it due to their subpar processors, which aren’t ideal for heavy users or future-proofing. Money isn’t an issue—I just want a phone that delivers consistently great point-and-shoot performance, excels at video recording, handles dynamic shots without missing the moment, and comes with a solid software update policy (at least 5 years).

Should I wait for the Xiaomi 15 Ultra since 14 ultra did fantastic job, or is there another Android flagship that checks all these boxes?

post,1i14jcy,smartphones,Stay with Apple or buy Samsung (ultra)?,"Hi! 
I bought an Apple iPhone 14 Pro for the premiere. I've been using it for 2.5 years. I had an Android before (Xiaomi Black Shark 3). I would really like to buy a new phone, but I can't decide. Apple didn't show anything ambitious in September with new models (additionally, in the country where I live, AI and other additional functions don't work). I'm thinking about buying a Samsung s25 ultra for the premiere. Does anyone have a similar choice? I don't know whether to buy a Samsung or wait until the premiere of the iPhone 17 pro and consider buying it again? Or other smartphone you are recommend base on may matters?
From the things that matter to me: 
- working AI (in Samsung it works worldwide) - summarizing web pages or other notes.
- long-lasting battery - my current iPhone lasts all day on the battery, and when it was new it lasted 2,5 days - is it possible for it to last that long with Android? I've heard opinions that some people who changed from iPhone to Android thought the battery was broken because it didn't last that long.
- good camera - the photos the iPhone takes are breathtaking. will I be equally happy with the Samsung? does the AI ​​ruin the photos there? photos in total darkness when exposed without the use of the iPhone flash work great - can the Samsung do that too?
- background app operation - if I enter an app and stop in it and then look at it after 2 days it continues in the same place where I stopped! that's great. is android able to not close a process for that long?
- health app - setting the alarm by sleep schedule is great. I'm afraid that in android it is not
- Samsung dex - I would like to be able to connect my phone to a dock and use it like a computer. Does Samsung dex work well? I don't have that option on my current iPhone.
- phone size - I'm afraid the Samsung will be too long/tall. the iPhone's proportions are good - it's wide and long enough. most androids are excessively long, so you can't touch the top of the screen without moving your hand. it's annoying.

Edit: I bought s25 ultra.",2025-01-14 12:02:48,2,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1i14jcy/stay_with_apple_or_buy_samsung_ultra/,"camera, battery",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,TodEbil,0.75

post,1i6c5q7,smartphones,Help me pick cheaper alternatives for the Galaxy S24 Ultra,"# Summary 

Looking for alternative phones that perform almost as good as the Galaxy S24 Ultra 512gb, for a lot less of its retail price ($1500). Currently leaning on older flagships but will consider latest flagships if the price can be justified. I just want a phone that's practical and isn't a marketing gimmick tragedy.

My main considerations are the:

* Xiaomi 14T Pro 512gb | $700 
* Vivo x100 Pro 256gb | $660
* Google Pixel 9 Pro 256gb+ | $800-$1000
* Sony Xperia

# Criteria

After having the Galaxy S24 Ultra, my first flagship phone, for almost a whole year, I've learned a lot on what I want in a phone. I'm currently looking into a new one, and your insights and advice would be appreciated! Thanks!

I've done some research and used [GSMArena's Phone Finder tool](https://www.gsmarena.com/search.php3). I've got some options now, and I guess this post is about whether it's worth it or not. Also, I suck at researching and have trust issues with reviews, especially on YouTube, so here I am.

Here's my current criteria for a phone:

* **Price to value ratio & hardware longevity**
   * Learned the hard way that getting the latest flagships from Samsung/Apple at full price typically isn't worth it. 
   * I just want it to last me as long as it could and won't start to lag in just a few years.
   * Budget range would be around $600-$900 max, but if the price beyond could be justified, I'll consider it. 
   * *^(For reference, I got the S24 Ultra 512GB for $1500 last year with pre-order benefits, and I regret it big time.)* 
   * ^(Will consider second-hand/refurbished/renewed devices with warranty & 30 days return.)
* **Heat and Battery efficiency**
   * Battery life per charge that can last for at least 7 hours of screen-on time consistently.  *^(or just a whole day without having to charge on afternoon honestly)*
   * I don't want a phone that's being marketed with having a ""super powerful chip"" and ""super bright screen"" but in reality, heats up quick and throttles performance in just a few minutes of use when outdoors.
   * I play some games in high graphics & framerate, but I value stability and efficiency over performance. (At least 90fps)
* **Camera**
   * Has at least 24MP+, 55mm telephoto lens.
   * Able to record 4K 60fps on telephoto lens.
   * Good telephoto performance on mid-low light.
   * *Bigger sensor over phone aesthetics??*
   * *^((perhaps a camera that's also battery & heat efficient?))*
* **Storage**
   * At least 256 / 512gb, unless there are factors that can justify only 128GB.
   * I take a lot of pictures and videos when going outside. 
   * Also keep a lot of files on my phone. 
   * SD Card slot would be nice but not necessary.
* Others
   * Less marketing gimmicks, more practical features. 
      * I don't need super high megapixels, super high refresh rates, ""AI"" sh\*t.
   * Good aftersales is a myth in my country but let me know if there's a brand that has a good customer service reputation worldwide.

I realize this may be a lot of text, and tbh I just really want a phone that's ""worth it"".

# Other options:

* Google Pixel
   * *^(So far, I've been hearing good news about the latest Pixel 9. I'm also considering the older models, but I've heard something about their chips being inefficient or stuff.)*
   * *^(Might have issues with warranty and returns since I'll be bringing it to a country where it's not supported.)*
      * Pixel 9 Pro 256gb refurbished ($799 on Amazon US) (carrier unlocked)
      * Pixel 7 Pro 128gb ($430 on my local store)
* Vivo
   * *^(I've been seeing the x200 Pro being recommended by plenty of people online, but I'm not so sure.)* 
      * x200 Pro 512gb ($1200, will wait for when it drops)
      * x100 Pro (around $660)
      * other older models
* Xiaomi
   * I've been seeing the name a lot and on YouTube comparison videos. 
      * 14 Ultra
      * 14T Pro 512gb ($700 on official website)",2025-01-21 06:06:19,1,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1i6c5q7/help_me_pick_cheaper_alternatives_for_the_galaxy/,"camera, battery, performance, price",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,j_aeli,1.0
post,1h1xaey,smartphones,What smartphone to buy?,"Edit: Thanks everyone for your suggestions! The Google Pixel 9 pro was the most suggested, but I will go with the 8 pro because I found some really good black week deals on it.


Hi y'all, I want to buy a new smartphone this black week. I'm looking for a high end to flagship phone. I'm not willing to exceed $1000 in price. I don't enjoy navigating in IOS so Apple is out of the selection.

Most important to me is a good camera.
Good and quick software updates would be cool too. Durability also matters to me.

I don't care about screen brightness at all and performance isn't super important to me. Battery time also doesn't matter that much. I don't need AI but won't complain if it's there.

If there's something else important to you about a phone feel free to ask me what I think ig that helps you help me.

post,1i11fxp,smartphones,IQOO 12 Review (After a year of use),"I got the IQOO 12 in the first week of Jan 2024 and I have been using it as my daily driver for a year now. The main reason I am writing this review is because in the upcoming sale the phone is selling for 42,000 INR and it’s pricing is very similar to the Oneplus 13R and a lot of people don’t know which phone to pick for the price.

While I have not used a Oneplus 13R yet I can share my experience with the IQOO 12 because I have used the phone for over a year as my daily driver now. Hopefully this can help some people in their buying decisions.

The review is going to he split up into different sections so if you want to just read about one aspect of the phone you can just read that.

**Unboxing**

The unboxing experience is good. Everything you need to get started is already included in the box. Things that are included in are

1.       The phone

2.       A transparent TPU case

3.       120W Charging Brick

4.       Type-C To C cable

5.       User Manual

6.       Warranty Card

7.       Sim Tool

8.       The BMW M Motorsport Cardboard cutout thing

Overall, a very solid unboxing and you get everything you need to start using the phone.

**Display**

The display is just amazing, with great viewing angles, colors and a high resolution this display is just a joy to use. The 6.78-inch size may be a big for some but most flagships are even bigger so ig this is not a problem for most people.

The color accuracy is really good and you can do color sensitive work on this screen. The peek brightness of 3000 nits is only available on a 1% window when watching HDR content on a platform like Netflix or youtube, but with the slider the screen can do to around 800 nits and with HBM can go upto 1400 nits with makes the screen very usable even under direct sunlight.

The 120 Hz refresh rate helps the display feel smooth in day to day use and the LTPO tech works amazing well with the screen going to 1Hz while idle and on the AOD.

Over the display is amazing and definitely a highlight of this phone.

**Build Quality**

The phone feels very solid in the hand and feels very well built. The flat edges give it a slight iphone feel when holding it, but the back glass slightly curves into the housing so the phone does not dig into your hand while using it.

The IP 64 rating is good and will protect it form stuff like rain and water splashes but use in a pool or anything like that is not ideal. The back glass feels nice and made well. I use a case all the time so I can’t really comment on that. Also, the white “legend” variant, the color you see on sites like amazon and even on IQOOs own site make it seem like it back is pure white but in reality, it’s a little off white which I actually prefer over pure white.

Overall, the phone feels like a flagship and showing be durable for a good while.

**Performance**

Just as a frame of reference I had the Xiaomi 11T Pro before I got the IQOO 12 and the performance improvement was really good. The SD 888 is still a great chip and performs well to this day, but the 8 Gen 3 just makes everything feel so snappy and fluid for day-to-day use.

Everything from opening apps to taking photos feels like it happens instantly and it’s a massive jump of from the 888. Now if what most people want to know. How good is it for gaming? And it’s amazing but I think everyone expected that considering that this is a IQOO device.

Now I am not much or a mobile gamer but the games I did test run extremely well on max graphics. Games like Genshin impact ran at a solid 60FPS even after over an hr. of continuous play. Other games like PUBG, CODM and wild rift ran very well. Plus, will all the stuff that IQOO/ VIVO have got gaming, it’s just really good.

Also, the temps where under control and never felt like the phone was getting too hot or unusable. The one downside I can see is the USB-C 2.0 port on the phone will not allow you to add an external display for use one for capture, so if that is important to you then keep that in mind.

Overall, the phones performance is just amazing for the price. Everything from gaming to just taking pictures feels like it happens instantly.

**OS**

Oh boy……. Funtouch OS. The amount of people that say that Funtouch OS is trash without using it is just funny to me. I will agree that the older versions of Funtouch OS where not the best but especially with Funtouch OS 14 Vivo really did step up their game.

Everything in the OS feels smooth and polished. It was never laggy or slow at any point and there is a lot of customizations options. Is it perfect? No, Is it the best android OS? No, but it’s a great OS that does nothing bad. With the android 15 update the OS has become more refined with better features and more AI features.

I can tell you one thing but it was way better that whatever version of dogshit MIUI I was using on my 11T Pro, but Xiaomi has also improved a lot with Hyper OS so props to them as well.

Overall Funtouch OS is good and it should not be the deciding factor if you where planning to buy this phone.

**Cellular Connectivity**

The phone supports all of the most common 5G bands and connection has been great for me. I have never had any connections issues and I have never had connection drop for no reason. The 5G speeds do depend on there you live, but for me I got around 700 Mbps connection with Jio.

Overall, I don’t have much to say really. The connectivity is great and works very well.

**Cameras**

I was surprised that the cameras where this good.

The rear camera setup is a proper setup with no bs 8 MP Ultra-wide or 2 MP Macro. The specs of the rear cameras are: -

50 MP, f/1.7, 23mm (wide), 1/1.3"", 1.2µm, multi-directional PDAF, OIS  
64 MP, f/2.6, 70mm (periscope telephoto), 1/2.0"", PDAF, OIS, 3x optical zoom  
50 MP, f/2.0, 15mm, 119˚ (ultrawide), AF

\*Source – GSMArena

The main camera is very capable to capture great images during the day time. The images come out with good colors, great clarity and great detail. The low light performance is great as well but these is the down side that sometimes it does make night time shots too bright.

When capturing human subjects, the skin tone is generally captured well, but sometimes it may tend to make a skin tone more red.

The Ultra-wide camera has similar color sense as the main and performs very similar to the main camera.

The phone can capture video 4k@60 and [8k@30](mailto:8k@30). The 4k video from the main camera comes out with great quality with great detail, good contrast and great white balance. The stabilization is great while recording at 4k but the 8k stabilization while being good could have been better.

The periscope telephoto camera is one of this phone’s main highlights of the phone. With the 3x optical zoom the phone is able to capture absolutely amazing portrait shots. The advertised 100x is not the best but it does get the job done and with the help of some image processing test of a sign or billboard for far can be read decently well.

Overall, the cameras did impress me. For this price you get a lot of cameras for your money.

**Conclusion**

For the sale price I do think that this is a real contender for the best phone under 50k. With amazing build quality, great camera and amazing performance the IQOO 12 should be in your list if you are looking to buy a phone under 50k on this sale.

If you feel like I forgot to mention something or that I made a mistake please do let me know :)

La compañía quiere asaltar el podium de la gama media con un terminal que es toda una oda a la marca, hasta el punto de que en su diseño se ha «ocultado» el icónico diseño del logo de Xiaomi en el modulo de cámaras. Si nos fijamos en el diseño de este modulo, veremos que es prácticamente el mismo que el logo de la marca, dejando claro que Xiaomi tiene puestas muchas esperanzas en este terminal.

Conclusiones tras probarlo:

El Redmi Note 14 Pro es una opción que destaca por su precio de 399€ y del que nos ha gustado su diseño, rendimiento y pantalla, pero que ha defraudado con sus cámaras macro y ultra gran angular. Si bien el sistema va muy fluido en la mayoría de ocasiones, se nota que en momento puntuales le cuesta acarrear con trabajos como el procesado de las fotografías de 200MP. Por fortuna estas no son realmente necesarias en la mayoría de ocasiones, por lo que podemos decir que es un problema muy puntual.

El Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G de seguro será un éxito de ventas, al igual que sus predecesores, pero no por ello Xiaomi debería de acomodarse en los laureles. Como primera propuesta del año el Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G está claramente enfocado a un publico que busca **un terminal de precio ajustado y buen rendimiento**, con una muy buena pantalla y autonomía, que ve salvado el tema de la fotografía por la calidad de su lente principal. El conjunto es muy bueno, pero hay aspectos donde la compañía debería pensar ya en subir el listón y es que entre este modelo y el Note 14 Pro+ se me hace difícil escoger cual recomendar más.

I'm a gaming person if i say so myself but also that type of person who takes pictures and recording nature, so i made a list with the chosen phones and the struggle is real so help me out here:

Samsung Galaxy S24/S25 Ultra

OnePlus 13

Xiaomi 14T/15T/14 Ultra

IPhone 13-15 Pro Max/Plus (probably no) 

ASUS Rog 8 Phone Pro/7 Pro

Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro

Pixel 9 Pro/XL

Samsung and OnePlus are on my top list because here's the problem, Samsung is a great phone full of features and customization, like 200MP camera with a 120fps video recorder and has OneUI 6 with lock screen customization and 7 years of support. 

Meanwhile OnePlus has a 50MP camera with 60fps (idk if there is a 120fps option though), it's OS is more of a minimal feel so it literally has less customization for lock screen but apart from this, this beast has a 100W charging speed with 50W for wireless which beats Samsung for 45W (+65W with a third party charger) and 20W wireless, and not to say that OnePlus will have 24GB ram on their new upcoming phone OnePlus 13 and a 1TB storage (even though the S24 Ultra offers it already), sad thing is that it only gives 4 supports instead which gives me so little hope. 

And there's also competition in battery capacity with the S25 Ultra rumoring to keep the 5000maH battery while OnePlus already bringing a 6100maH battery.

I use them for work or perso.

I do have my own Sim, on an really old ilhone that do not start anymore..keeping my sim to keep my number mine in case of company change.

I read manga webtoon on the first mini iPad that doesn't support Safari YouTube or chrome anymore. Basically the only app running is the one I use to read manga.

I read books on a kobo oasis.

I use the Samsung to dumbscroll

I have a steamdeck for game and ""personal pc"" use with Google applications suites... everything being cloud based.

I have a separate portable screen for either the steamdeck or the laptop.


I am asking myself about buying:

A tablet: for manga reading.
Probably will be used for dumbscroll
Probably will be used for personal note taking (google note, google sheet.. if something else exist, even better!)
Probably to watch video

A smartphone:
To have my own one, With Sim and eSim in ordre to use the same smartphone for perso and pro à bit more legit.
To dumbscroll also (sadly)
To listen to podcast and audiobook

Nothing extravagant!
Also considering only buying a tablet, and having a perso eSim inside... since with earplugs you can phone call and stuff..

post,1dhkmop,smartphones,Iphone 15 vs Samsung 24(Exynos Variant) vs Pixel 8 vs Waiting ,"Hey guys, I come before the elders to seek some advice for my next handheld, they're all priced the same

My needs: Phone with a decent camera, smooth feeling display ( i.e higher than 60hz), decent performance ( I do some experimental ML work with TFlite from time to time ) and some light gaming.

**Samsung S24:** This is my top pick right now and I will probably end up buying this if I don't hear something majorly flawed with this. My only gripe is I feel like Samsung AI is the weakest of the top players ( Google and Apple) and they'll probably make it a subscription if the rumours are true.

**iPhone 15:** 60hz refresh rate is my biggest issue with this device ( WHY APPLE WHYYYY!! ), I have a Macbook but I am not looking to dive head first into this eco-system always been a Windows and Android guy and I use Mac only for presentations. Also, the base model will not be getting and AI features so that's a bummer. The pricing for its 128GB model is equivalent to 256GB variant of Samsung

**Pixel 8:** Worst performance of the bunch and that's my only problem, has good AI implementation and knowing Google and their Gemini Nano local model, I think we'll be getting something similar to Apple's implementation.

**Waiting:** This is only due to the Pixel, I like Pixel but the performance is really fucking do do, so this option is mostly reserved for Pixel, the new Pixel releases every October.

**Honourable** is **mention:** Xiaomi 14, a good phone overall, great specs and battery life, relatively small also BUT the software experience is the do do-est of them all. The OS on this flagship feels like it's from those ultra-budget phones.

post,1bth6we,smartphones,Looking for Android recommendations after a decade with Samsung phones,"I hope this is the right place to ask this, any recommendations are helpful.

My first Android about a decade or so ago was a Tracfone Samsung phone, a few years later a Galaxy Centura, and in 2017, a Galaxy S8. My S8 served me well for 5 years. I eventually upgraded to a Galaxy S22 Ultra. It has been mostly great, but I feel it has a lesser build quality than my previous device.

What I'm mainly looking for is solid durability, good performance, OLED and maybe a more reasonable price point. Samsung seems to want to be Korean Apple at this point, and I'm not particularly a fan of that. Basically, my S22 was partially bought as a PC-replacement, it's served that purpose so far. 

I have heard a lot of surprisingly good things about Google Pixel phones, have they significantly improved in quality? Always heard back in the day that they were buggy and unreliable.

post,1esns0k,smartphones,Current Xiaomi X3 Poco Pro User Looking To Upgrade,"Hi all,

Bit of back story, I've recently moved to Australia and have way more disposable income than I've ever had before, so when Optus (phone company) told me I need to upgrade my phone because the 3G network is going to he turned off, I thought I might go for a fancy top of the line phone.

The more I've thought about it though I'm not sure I actually need one for my usage and it seems overkill to spend 2 grand on something that 500 would be more than enough. 

I basically just use news apps, YouTube, Spotify, Reddit, messaging apps, and then stream live sports a fair bit via various apps. I don't play any games, although I'm tempted by Football Manager or maybe some emulators of old GBA/PS1 games. 

I don't really care for camera quality, I'm told the Xiaomi X3 Poco Pro I currently use (and am quite happy with tbh) has a fairly shit camera, but it looks alright to me. 

Basically my questions boil down to:

Should I really bother to get a top of the line phone with my usage, and what differences will I notice? 

Either way, which phone should I get based on the below:

Never had any issues with X3, but had my eye on Xiaomi 14 Ultra as I think that's their flagship. Also looked at the X6 as a like for like to my X3. 

I like the size of my X3, 165x77x9.4mm (6.5x3x0.3 inches) but don't really want to go much bigger, happy to go smaller, although as I watch a lot of vids, a big screen is nice. 

I ideally would like lots of storage (I download a lot of videos) 

I won't entertain Apple products.

I've been using a Xiaomi 11 Lite 5G NE since 2021, but it's been acting up lately. It started rebooting randomly the other day, and I've had ongoing performance issues—UI freezes, app crashes (especially the camera), and mobile data problems. I'm finally ready to switch phones.

I'll be starting university next year and will be out for most of the morning, so a battery that lasts is a must.

It's just so hard to choose a good phone nowadays. I've done some research but opinions differ some say that Xiaomi 14 ultra is the best one other say that you have to get Samsung s24 ultra because it's the best phone ect.

-best processor 
-great battery life
- storage of min. 512GB
-decent photos 
- 5g
-NFC
- it has to have Google Play Store access so new Huawei phones are out 

And if I can help it then 
-no curved edges, only flat screen 


Like I said I thought about Xiaomi 14/Xiaomi 14  ultra but there is a problem with lense fogging and with software?? The Samsung is more expensive with not that great battery also I would have to buy a charger too which makes it even more expensive.

post,1dhbus3,smartphones,Xiaomi 13T and why I bought it instead of a few others,"Hi everyone!  
I wanted to share my experience with this phone, since I often see it as an alternative in the 400-500€ price range, and a few considerations that lead me in buying it.

I was looking for a phone with great cameras at around 350-400€. At first I was stunned by the Nothing Phone 2a but, although very well thought and neat and unique (the UI is amazing), I saw the cameras were nice but nothing more (and with a terrible zoom).  
Then the Realme 12 Pro+ came out and its periscope lense is a killer feature for the price, but then it's got the awful and (sadly) widespread 8mpx ultrawide camera. Also, you can take 4k videos only with the main lens and can switch between the three only at 1080p 30 fps.  
The Google Pixel 7a? Great cameras, but I saw it live and was disappointed by the screen: washed out and not so bright. Then I read the battery is not so good and neither is the processor.

So I remembered I advised a relative of mine about the 13T a few months ago, but I was almost not considering it for myself since it's a Xiaomi, as I was coming from a Mi 9T. Don't get me wrong: I never had any issues with it in 4 years and simply loved it. I just wanted some changes in the interface etc.. Something new, different, that's it. But then I read lots of reviews, watched lots of videos (even in indian, thai and indonesian...), comparisons etc. and eventually opted for it.

Why? Because of the balance. I couldn't find any weak spots in it.  
No, it doesn't have a periscope 3x lens, nor is as beautiful as the Realme; but the ultrawide is a good 12mpx, it still has a 50mpx 2x telephoto and can shoot at 4k 30fps with all of the cameras (except the front) and the processor is better.  
No, it's not as neat and unique as the Nothing Phone; but it's better overall (except maybe the UI).  
No, it's not ""Google experience"" with its features and ""AI-ish"" things (has a few, like a ""magic rubber"" in photo editing); but it has a great screen and better processor and, from what I've seen, the same picture quality overall but with more versatility thanks to the different focal lenght of the 2x camera.

So I bought it and I must confirm all of the things I thought. It's pretty powerful, fast (UFS 3.1), has an amazing screen (and I don't care that much about the 144hz thing. I even disabled it 'cause, to me, it's just something that drains battery out of smartphones with no real benefit), the battery is satisfying, the charger is not an exaggerated 120w one that reduces battery life so much in the long run (if I'm not in a hurry I still use the 9T one anyway) and great cameras. The main one, especially, is truly amazing. I don't know if it's because of the Leica partnership but with the Mi 9T you needed the Google Camera to take decent night photos: here you don't, and the pictures in any conditions look very natural, smooth and detailed (and, needless to say, a lot better than the 9T). You can even take LOG videos.

I genuinely thought Samsung S series, although their ""fake blue"" sky effect, was the best, or one of the best, Android phone for taking pictures, but was disappointed after seeing different comparisons between S23/24 (even the Ultra) and the Xiaomis with Leica. Samsung's photos looked great at first glance but then it took a couple of seconds of observation to see they were so artificially sharpened and noisy, while Xiaomis' (13T, 13T pro and the 14 series) were way better and looked like actual photos, rather than a smartphone picture artifacts party.

So while the other smartphones I considered had each its highs and lows, the 13T has highs that may not be as incredible as others' (like the periscope lens on the Realme) but has none of the lows. It does everyting at a high level (the main camera is almost on par with the best out there) and has, excluding the HyperOS major update and considering you buy it today, a 3+4 years update policy (the newer Realme 12 Pro+, for instance, has a 2+3).

Only two things are not that great. One is the design, that I like, it's decent... but it's not the best I've seen nor had. But I use covers on smartphones, so I've found a nice one online. And if you buy the black version of the 13T, I recommend you use one anyway, even the transparent one that comes with it, since the reflecting back of the phone is a fingerprint magnet.  
The other one is a bug with HyperOS, so like 30% of the times you get a notification, it shows for a couple of seconds on the lockscreen and then disappears: it doesn't show on the always-on, lockscreen or anything and you have to unlock the phone to see it. It's pretty annoying and I hope Xiaomi will fix it (yes, I know the MIUI/Xiaomi reputation in terms of bugs and stuff, but I had none with the 9T. Luck? Maybe) but until then I'm getting used to unlock the phone from time to time.

Hope this helps anyone interested in the phone or facing indecisions between some of the ones I've mentioned.",2024-06-16 16:53:44,6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1dhbus3/xiaomi_13t_and_why_i_bought_it_instead_of_a_few/,"camera, battery, design, price",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,uppertime,0.88

What are anyone's experiences using CN version in Canada  what do you sacrifice, according to Bing Copilot the Xiaomi will fully function on Bell 5g network but it sounded slightly shilly for AI on that one. Vivo CN shows even less 5g bands. I am currently with Freedom where apparently their 5g isnt a whole lot better than 4g currently which does the job for me. Bell 5g+ $40 a month more for 100gb  than Freedom I guess though thats like do I get the $120 ounce of mids or the $200 ounce of quads, and that is another story for another post lol.

Plus, with leaks suggesting no major screen upgrades for the S25U, it’s hard to justify it.

I’m not a fan of iOS, but the iPhone seems like a safer long-term option despite my dislike for the ecosystem.

That said, I’m also considering whether the OnePlus 13 or iQOO 13 might be better for longevity, especially if other flagship options this year aren’t worth the price. Money isn’t the issue; I just want the overall best flagship mobile that balances performance, durability, and long-term value.

Should I consider waiting for the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, or is it better to stick with one of the current options? What would you recommend for someone looking for the ultimate flagship?

post,1ggc0h3,smartphones,Samsung S24 or Xiaomi 14 ?,"I want to change my phone (iPhone 12). 

I have nothing against iOS but the phones are really expensive for my use and the 60hz for the non-pro models will get the best of me given the price.

Now, my essential criterion is a small phone (between 6.1 and 6.3 inches) In this range after a lot of research there are two good phones: Samsung Galaxy S24 and Xiaomi 14. Where I live they are almost the same price currently and at a good price (around 600 euros) which I think is very good value for money whatever happens for both models. 

Both have enough power and a photo-video sensor that is more than sufficient for my use. My main criteria is battery life and the smoothness of the OS.

I have inquired about One UI and Hyper OS but I cannot realize the big differences as a user, Hyper OS aesthetically I like a lot because it looks more like iOS, but I have heard a lot of badly on it.

post,1ij03q1,smartphones,"Xiaomi 14T vs iPhone 14 experience, it's been interesting","I keep phones for a while, at least 5 years, so I've been taking my time to choose an upgrade to my old Oneplus 6T.

I managed to get two devices to test out from Amazon.

Xiaomi 14T EUR470 and iPhone 14 EUR620

It's been a super interesting journey! I'm a mac user and here are my thoughts:

1. People really criticise Xiaomi battery life and rave on about iPhone, but I have found discharge rates to be very similar, with 14T sometime doing better (normal producivty use, no gaming)

2. The 14T is far and above the better hardware device. The screen is so big and bright. And.. this is a weird one I didn't expect. The 14T is way more reliable with touch sensitivity. I find the iPhone sometimes not picking up taps or missing where I'm tapping (also small screen, adult hands etc).

3. HyperOS for the win with notifications, keyboard and general navigation around the OS.

4. Some people hate HyperOS for being too iOS like. But as someone who loves that syle of OS with animations and effects hyperOS is pretty polished next to iOS.

5. It's insane how much better the 14T is in some way when you take into account the pricing.

6. BUT, iOS just nails a few little usability things. Like the way you interact with Siri is just so much nicer. How it responds, how it takes action. It might not be as feature rich as gemini assitant, but it's a nicer experience.

7. I do love iOSes privacy focus, especially compared to HyperOS.

8. The integration with Mac, especially phone mirroring is awesome.

9. There's just so many nice touches by Apple, like how if my phone is next to my Mac and it's face up and I say Hey Siri the phone answers. But if I face it down and say hey siri the Mac answers. It's ultimately an insignificant feature, except I love they thought of that. and there's other little touches like phone backup/restore, stacked widgets etc.

10. Also, there's no bloatware but also I'm not randomly taken to ads sometimes like in HyperOS. For example, if I want to change sounds I don't need to go through a horrible xiaomi store.

It's hard. The 14T is clearly the better device in terms of hardware, and the software is great. But iOS feels like it isn't trying so hard, it's a bit classier, it's not trying to grab your data, there's no a million overlapping configuration options and the mac integration is first class.

It's a device vs philosophy argument I think.

This could all go away with a better iPhone, like a pro or something, but then I do really think they are so overpriced.. so its tricky!

I want to make the best bang-for-the-buck decision between these two, like which one is better in both battery, screen, camera, processor, storage, you get the gist of it.

Its not that big of a price difference between the two here, only a 140 buck jump on the S23FE compared to the Note 14 Pro.

I don't really care about camera as long as it is decent and it works quickly. Before the iphone I had a oneplus and found the camera laggy af and it was infuriating.

  
I'm not tied to any ecosystem, I love how the 12 is still fluid after all these years, and also software supported, but I really do not enjoy iOS. The lack of a consistent back gesture, and some UX choices that make basic tasks very long winded are infuriating.

I love face ID for logging into secure apps, and making payments.

  
Concerns about the S24 - I live in an Exynos market, and my memory of Samsung is a slowy, laggy UI, howeer that was years ago.

  
Xiaomi 14 seems nice, good specs, I have concerns about the software experience and software support over time. I also find conflicting info about whether google pay and other secure apps work with biometric login. I really want to be able to keep logging in and paying with my face and/or fingerprint.

  
Oneplus 12 isn't on the above list bc it just looks massive.

post,1gxf0z0,smartphones,Should I Sell My iPhone 14 Pro and Use an S22 Ultra Instead?,"
Hi everyone, I’m in a bit of a situation and could use your advice. I’m considering selling my iPhone 14 Pro to cover some urgent financial needs. My backup plan is to switch to a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (Snapdragon), which is a spare phone that my family used previously but no longer needs.

Financially, I’d be fine even if I don’t sell the phone, but selling it would give me a bit of extra security. Do you think this is a good decision?

I’m familiar with both iOS and Android, so the OS change isn’t a concern. However, I have a few specific questions:

1. Is the S22 Ultra (Snapdragon) still a good choice in 2024 for everyday use?
2. How does the camera performance compare between the two, especially for casual photography?
3. Are there any noticeable differences in battery life between these phones?
4. Any key features from the iPhone 14 Pro that I might miss after switching?
5. Would you consider this a good trade-off, given my situation

For context, I plan to use the S22 Ultra for 1–2 months while things stabilize financially. After that, I’m considering upgrading to an iPhone 15 Pro or 16 Pro. In your opinion:

1. Would upgrading to a 15 Pro or 16 Pro be a noticeable improvement over the 14 Pro?
2. Or would it make more sense to save money and just stick with another 14 Pro later?

That said, there’s also a chance I might end up liking Android and sticking with it.

The iphone is still working perfectly fine, it has 87 % battery capacity. I mostly use my phone for chatting on social media, sometimes make some pictures and some games. 

What I like on iPhones is that they last really long, I still have my first 6S at home and when I turned it on lately it was still working kinda fine but from what I remember from the times when I was android user, they usually started to lag after 2 years which never happened to me with iphone but at those times I was also using cheaper phones so I know I can't really compare that and I know that new phones in medium-higher prices are probably way better than it was before.

Recently, during Black Friday in my country, Huawei launched a promotion for the Pura 70 Ultra with the Watch GT4 for $780 USD, which I think is a good deal considering its normal price. However, it’s still quite a lot of money for a phone. In fact, it would be my first time buying a new flagship, as I usually buy second-hand.

While searching for phones, I came across a refurbished Mi 11 Ultra for $290 USDon AliExpress. The question is which option would be better. Considering that the Huawei was just released this year, while the Xiaomi came out in 2021 and is refurbished, plus the prices and features they offer based on what I like about my Mi 11T Pro.

post,1dv4w9s,smartphones,Galaxy S23 Ultra vs Iphone Pro 14 Max for my business,"Usually an Android/Samsung fan but I'm stick and tired of my just over a year old Exynos Galaxy S22 Ultra. The battery is just dire for a smartphone of this price. I have to run the thing in power saving 24/7, and even then, it's not great. The processor is just awful for a device of this price; it gets hot quickly, and the phone freezes up. I seem to get strange network issues when it drops out; another friend with a flip who comes from an iPhone has noticed the modem doesn't seem as good as Apple's, especially in heavy-traffic areas like London. The mobile phone is used for business; I'm not sitting there all day wanting to customise my home screen. 

I want a practical device with good battery life and reliability. I'm leaning towards the iPhone for the first time in my life. I am not interested in the latest devices with their price premium, so I will return to a previous series. 

My only concern is that when trying them at my local John Lewis, I prefer the Samsung's screen/look/feel. It just feels like a nicer phone to use for business. I like having the back button. I no longer trust Samsung; there are no excuses for having the odd bad release, with the prices often being iPhone-level or more. 

Should I give Samsung another chance? I heard good things about the S23 Ultra, but could you let me know if the issues I experience are ironed out or if it is best that I switch? Looking for people who have had real-life experience with both devices.

post,1d2i5um,smartphones,Managed to grab myself a used Xiaomi Mi 6 for 14$ (with a slight issue),"I think I got one hell of a deal from the used marketplace. I bought a Xiaomi Mi 6 for 14$ which is a flagship phone from 2017. The only issue is that it's screen is broken which can be mitigated a little by lowering brightness.

I don't know what do you call this issue but when the phone is in max brightness slider, all the pixels that are supposed to be black glitches out and outputs colorful pixel, sometimes white mess. I also noticed that it somewhat ""remembers"" the old pixels of the phone. You can see it in the screenshot when I'm booting it up with Mi logo. It shows the time and date even though I'm only booting it up. May someone tell me what do you call this specific display issue?

Anyway, I managed to install LineageOS and magisk-root it. And damn, it's one hell of a phone for 14$. If only the screen was a bit more presentable it would've been perfect :D

I have no problem with the current screen display since I'm only using it as a google photo backup phone. And also, I can just lower the brightness to lessen the broken effect.

I have had Xiaomi phones for the last 8 years and whilst I do love them for the value they offer, I feel like the microphone always ends up going after a year or two. Wondering if it's time to make the switch to a Samsung...

I would like to buy a flagship like phone since I did have a flagship phone since my LG G2, which was released 10 years ago and had 1080 60 video recording capabilities.

I would like to have a phone with a good camera ( 8k video ).

 Also it should have a nice display for reading. I find personally  IPS displays more comfortable for my sensitive eyes but there are not available anymore. I saw POCO M4 Pro display which is AMOLED DotDisplay.and I like it. It is like a paper. On the other hand, I find CrystalRes AMOLED, which was used for 13t pro, a bit too vivid. But there is little to do about the displays.

And when it comes to games, I never play games on the phone. 

I will use my new phone for filming, reading and browsing.

I was planning to buy S24+ but now Xiaomi 14 has changed my mind. but I am still not sure if I should spend almost double money  for a phone that can just record 8k videos.

The prices, I will use ""units"" to simplify, for the phones as follows

Xiaomi 14 512 gb           :  5 units money with a gift

Samsung s24+ 256 gb   :  5 units money 

Iphone 14  128 gb          : 5 units money ( I find iPhone screens a bit too vivid too)

Xiaomi 13t pro  512 gb  :  almost 4 units money.

Xiaomi 12  256 gb          :  almost 3 units

post,1hpnyyy,smartphones,Thinking of ditching Samsung for a OnePlus when I next upgrade,"I won't be upgrading for a while, but having sort of fallen down quite an extensive rabbit hole of bingewatching phone and tech reviews, I am thinking of leaving Samsung for the first time in FIFTEEN YEARS to try out a OnePlus. It really seems of all the phone companies, especially in the Android realm, OnePlus is the only true rival to Samsung.

But I do feel Samsung has gotten a little complacent in its recent years. It's not really innovating anymore. It's releasing the same phones every year it seems. But OnePlus appears to be absolutely leaping and bounding ahead in most ways. At least on paper. I'm sure there are sacrifices I'd be making, like the camera isn't as good I don't think, and no S Pen (yes I do actually use that). But idk, maybe after 15 years it's time for a change, at least when the time to upgrade comes. The OnePlus 13 looks way more promising than the upcoming S25 Ultra in every way.

Has anyone on here switched from Samsung to OnePlus? Would I be making a huge mistake doing this?

Note that Xiaomi, Vivo, and Huawei are not readily available where I live, and I'd never get those phones anyway. And I have no interest in iPhones or Pixels either (I think they are inferior to both Samsung and OnePlus, fight me).

post,1i86aml,smartphones,What phone should I buy?,"Recently, two new phones were released: the OnePlus 13 and the Galaxy S25. Which one should I get?

I currently use the Galaxy S20 FE, and I love it, it serves me well. I also own the Galaxy S22, which I bought used, but its battery life has been terrible, so I plan to trade it in for a new phone. I’ve owned the OnePlus 2 and 5 in the past, and I really liked them, especially the OxygenOS experience.

The AI features on the S25 don’t seem very useful to me. The “circle to search” feature looks cool, but I’m not sure how often I’d use it. I don’t care much about the camera, but I do like the fast charging and bigger battery on the OnePlus 13. Both phones have great screens with 120Hz refresh rates, which is a must for me. The smaller size of the S25 is also very appealing.

I’m also considering the OnePlus 13R, the phone looks like a great deal for a great phone. Another option is the Galaxy Flip 6. It seems cool, and I’ve never owned a foldable before, but I’m worried about durability. 😄

Here’s a breakdown of the prices and trade-in offers I’ve seen:

* **OnePlus 13**: €1,050, with up to €200 for trading in my S22. It includes a case but not the fast charger, which costs €70 extra.
* **Galaxy S25**: €910 (or €880 with discounts right now), with up to €300 for trade-in.
* **OnePlus 13R**: €750, with up to €200 for trade-in.
* **Galaxy Flip 6**: €900, with up to €450 for trade-in. Also, 50% off accessories with the Flip 6.

Of course, the trade-in prices depend on my S22 being in acceptable condition. It’s not cracked and still turns on, but the corners are scratched, and the back isn’t very clean. I’ve read that acceptable wear and tear should be fine for trade-ins, though.

Any suggestions? Or maybe there’s an upcoming phone I should wait for?",2025-01-23 15:46:12,5,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1i86aml/what_phone_should_i_buy/,"camera, battery, price",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,ClickAffectionate193,1.0

I haven't looked recently, but I know Xiaomi, OPPO, Huawei, and others are names I've seen before as ""Samsung killers"". While that seems like a stretch, they certainly compete.

Has anyone actually made the switch to a premium phone outside of Samsung, Apple, or Google? How did it go? Are you glad you switched? Is it a vastly different experience, or essentially the same?

post,1i8spev,smartphones,Help me pick a phone,"I currently have the Honor Magic 6 Lite and I am not looking to change it just yet. 

I am happy with the phone it is very good for the price. However, I am saving up for a new one and I am debating on what to buy next. 

I own a pretty even mix of devices (Apple & Android) and in terms of OS I can't say I have. A preference. I do enjoy both and do adapt to a new OS pretty seamlessly. 

All of my subscriptions are mostly through Google play. I have had all sorts of phones in the past:-

iPhone 4 (awful), iPhone 8 (really good and lasted 6 years), iPhone 12 (awful).

I have 2 Samsung phones from the Galaxy A series. 1 I loved and was better than the iPhone 12 but it needed replacing after 18months as it was constantly crashing. I bought the newer version and it was horrible and again needed changing after about 12 months. That's when I switched to Honor. 

I don't want to be spending more than £700 on a phone really. I know high end models usually have a poored battery than mid range and budget. 

I am considering the following:-

iPhone 15 or 16.
Google Pixel 8 or 9 either pro or standard versions. 
The upcoming Samsung Galaxy s25. 

I use my phone for the basic tasks, don't take many photos, I don't play games and I don't have social media accounts. I just us it for shopping and browsing and messaging and YouTube. I just want a battery that will last all day. 

I currently have the Honor Magic 6 Lite which has performed well and I do like it, but the camera isn't the best and I don't think it is that reliable regarding notifications. 

I am also not sure about switching everything over from Google Play to App Store. That might be a pain.

I've also debated to keep an Android phone and invest in an iPad to replace my Samsung one which is starting to struggle. ",2025-01-24 10:47:15,3,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1i8spev/help_me_pick_a_phone/,"camera, battery, price",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,DiscussionNew907,1.0

post,1ieael3,smartphones,Why's youtube and instagram videos look sharper on iphone compared to android?,"So the context here is, I was a hard core Samsung fan boy for almost 10 years until I switched from Samsung S22 ultra to iPhone 14 pro max in 2022. And one interesting thing is, this is the first time I have kept a phone with me for almost 2 years. In the past I always used to change the phone every 8 to 10 months. 

Anyway that aside, now I was planning on picking up the S25 Ultra, but since I am really used to iPhone and in general IOS, I wanted to be very sure before switching. So I did an extensive comparison between my iPhone 14 PM with the S25U. My usage is mostly content consumption on YouTube and instagram. So I played same videos (not the typical scenic HRD videos, but just regular videos of reviews and stuff) on YouTube and to my surprise, my iPhone 14PM which is 2 years old clearly looked sharper. I had set S25U screen resolution to maximum and also played the videos on both phones at full HD resolution. Also opened a couple of same Instagram reels on both the phones and again same thing happened, the reels just looked a tad bit sharper on my iPhone. 

I even shot a few pictures of a person on both the phones and again the 3x telephoto lens on iPhone clearly took sharper pictures. I mean the right comparison would have been to transfer photos shot on both phones to a computer and compare them side by side which I couldn't do. But at least looking at those pictures on the respective displays the iPhone 14PM clearly took sharper pictures with better details on the skin. So now I am really not sure if I want to switch.

I know this question was probably asked around a billion times, but hopefully you guys can help. 
I’m coming from a iPhone 14 Pro Max that decided it was time to say goodbye, and I was wondering what phone between these two was better. 
In terms of price I can find both at around 900€ in Italy for the 128gb and 256gb. 
I know that the S25 Ultra is around the corner but if the leaks are correct I probably can’t manage to spend that much. 
Thanks in advance for the suggestion!

Unfortunately, my samsung A52s 5G stop working without any explanation (its a board problem i think), so i need to buy a new smartphone. I only have this two options tho (because i need to buy the phone from the vodafone store). Im very much undecided about this after watching like 15+ different videos on this matter.

What i could learn from it is that:

\- Note 13 Pro+: has a better quality of screen (with more resolution , higher dpi and brightness and with a curved screen), better charging (120W) and with a better performance (with the mediatek 7200 Ultra)

\- A55: Better camera (more consistent), performance A LITTLE BIT worse than the redmi (for like games and such), and a better operative system (better then the HyperOs from xiaomi at least)

  
So i know the 2 of them arent perfect and i need to choose base of my needs, but im really confused on what should i do.

Just for information, I am a government employee who works in Public Relations. I also have a Macbook Air M2 as a laptop for me to work. But I never use the Apple Ecosystem (because I prefer to use Google). I also like playing games (PUBGM, MLBB, and the like).

I intend to replace both devices for several reasons:
First, because I have a bit of difficulty using 2 devices at once.
Second, I actually prefer using Android because I am free to choose applications.
Third, initially I bought the iPhone 15 Pro to play on social media. Then bought the Xiaomi 14T Pro for my Android needs. Therefore, I want to replace them to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra as an All in One device.

Do you have any suggestions? Should I keep using my current 2 devices or still replace them to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra? Or should I just stick with the Xiaomi 14T Pro?

post,1haeile,smartphones,"S22 ultra owner, should i switch to the iphone 16 pro max?","Hey everyone, just wanted to get some help regarding whether it is a good idea to upgrade to iphone.

This post is quite long so TL;DR: damaged charging port, don't know if I should fix and stay with what I currently have. Thinking about upgrading to the iphone after many years with many different androids to try something new, worried about some features, losing features and potentially making a bad decision about moving to the iphone.



Why I created this post: my s22 ultra is serving me well. Absolutely no complaints. Takes stunning pictures and is just a high quality device, even after almost 3 years. Sometimes it lags while booting up the phone after updates and such but it doesn't really bother me. My phone sometimes also opens random apps when I turn on the phone for some reason haha.

What IS an issue for me though is the charging port. It became so damaged to the point that I have to hold it in a specific way for it to charge, basically playing games with the charging port until I hit the right angle. Sometimes it doesnt even work. I tried to remove the dust and lint the port had but didn't pull anything which might have been causing the problem. Probably got damaged with time.

I never really liked iphones. I thought they were featureless, bland, and overly expensive. I used to think that based on my trials with it here and there, things people wrote and the comparisons of the ios with the Android.

I always had androids. S3, zte, xiaomis, probably other brands. You name it. Tried many variations of phones that each of them had their own UI, with Xiaomi's UI being closer to the ios.
I must say that I LOVE oneui, I think it's the best android UI I came across, ever. It's so feature-rich, very customizable, and it just looks good.

I recently started getting curious about ios and the iphone, since many people have it, say it's great and it has great camera quality.
Here is why I'm on the fence whether I should buy it or not: Been since forever with androids, gone through many Android versions and phones. Think it's time to change to try something new, but have two sides that hold me.
One side tells me it might be a bad idea to upgrade to the iphone, the other side thinks I should try it. This is why i made this post.

Some of the things which I'm not sure about if I'll upgrade to the iphone: Battery life (better daily usage? Can hold for a day or more like my s22 ultra can? Charges fast like the s22 ultra?), Camera quality (is it better, or comparable to the s22 ultra?), Screen (is the screen quality better? More durable than what I have? I know that Samsung provides them, obviously.), Sound (better sound quality?), Price (does the price justify the phone and the specs? Won't I pay only for the apple logo on the phone knowing the iphone is ""a status symbol""? Should I also trade in my s22 ultra to get the price down?), and, the most important question: ios. Will I love it the same as I love the oneUI?

Appreciate anyone who helps.",2024-12-09 17:04:59,1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1haeile/s22_ultra_owner_should_i_switch_to_the_iphone_16/,"camera, battery, price",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,_Onyxx1_,0.67
post,1i7apzz,smartphones,Hot take - I kinda like my Xiaomi 14T and HyperOS?,"Ok, my last phone and my wife's phone is a OnePlus. I have a Mac and iPad so I know a bit of iOSesque (kinda).

There a few things I HATE about HyperOS (I'm on v1 and this is my first Xiaomi phone ever - the 14T not pro):

1. I hate that to get to choosing sounds setting I have to go through a Xiaomi store front

2. I kinda hate themes. They look great, but they're implementation isn't polished in my opinion.

3. Battery drain is real, as is buggy implementation of battery saver, especially for audio playback when paused.

4. Initial bloatware /services you have to remove are annoying

5. cookie consent on the files app.. yikes.

6. Some default can't be changed (I'd like google files to be my default file manager)

BUT, having said all that, I otherwise love it. I know that's a lot, but most of that stuff I don't really see on a day to day. I just think it LOOKS great, especially on the 14T screen. Animations are solid, smooth, fast and responsive.

It's night and day compared to Oxygen on my wife's Nord 4 (I think it's Oxygen 14 so may change a lot with 15). Oxygen in comparison feel unresponsive becuase it doesn't have the great transitions and animations on HyperOS.

I do hope Xiaomi dial down the bloat stuff on v2.

BUT, I got it brand new for EUR470 here in Spain.. anything else even close is at least 100 to 200 more expensive and the benefits and debetable.",2025-01-22 13:08:41,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1i7apzz/hot_take_i_kinda_like_my_xiaomi_14t_and_hyperos/,battery,Xiaomi 14 Ultra,thisandyrose,0.67
post,1i0l12o,smartphones,Disappointment with Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra,"For a few years now, Samsung Galaxy Smartphones were my favorite brand when it came to buying them, especially with the arrival of One UI and its customization layer and later due to its collaboration with Google, becoming the second most updated brand.
Until I bought the S24 ultra and in a matter of the first 3 months I had 2 factory defects. The first, the charging port broke down and they fixed it, but only a month later, the image stabilizer when taking videos vibrated and made noises (defects that happened to many and even in previous ultra models I read What was happening too...)
Well, I got tired and decided to sell it and even though the exchange rate was lower, I bought the Google Pixel 8 pro.
I was certainly looking for a great camera on a mobile phone and I chose well.
Yes, it is true that I miss One UI and its customization, certain native photo editing modes and little else. But overall the Pixel 8 pro is a great device.
I don't plan to change my mobile at least until early 2026.
So I'm looking forward to seeing what the future Pixel 10 pro and S26 ultra will be like.

I wanted to ask several things to those interested about this topic.

Have you had problems with the Samsung Galaxy and have you changed brands?

Do you think it's better to stay with the Google Pixel or should I give Samsung another chance?

Any other brand that takes great photos like the Google Pixel pro and updates as frequently as Samsung? I rule out the Xiaomi ones, I already had them and I don't feel very comfortable with them.

On a smartphone my priority is the camera, native customization and updates.
For now, and with the exception of customization, the Google pixels do more than enough. Since I'm looking for photos with natural colors and well, the Samsungs have a great camera but they saturate and contrast more than I would like. The interpretation of each manufacturer is a matter of taste.

And another option is iPhone but I prefer Android.

post,1gi0ihp,smartphones,Looking for a new phone below 500 euros,"As the title says, i'm looking for a new phone, to replace the one i'm using now (realme 9 pro +), because regardless it being not so old, its annoyingly laggy, and the lack of any ip rating has revealed itself problematic (i had it in my pocket during a particulary rainy day, got soaked in water, and the phone received some water damage, that didnt help his situation).

I live in Italy, and my maximum budget is 500 euros (even tho i wouldn't hate finding something at a lower price than 500), but i will not buy the phone now, and i will rather wait for black friday, or even christmas (depending if i find a good deal).

As for what i'm looking for in a phone, is something with mostly a good battery life (i often find myself scrolling on social media for 2/3h, while on mobile data, while traveling), very good connectivity (i use the phone as a mobile routher for my laptop, so a very good connectivity is probably the most important thing), and also heat dissipation. What i mean by this, is that the phone must be capable of being used as a routher, in a room with a temperature of 35°C without combusting (the room might or might not have some airflow, depends on the day).

Its also important that it has some form of ip rating (the higher the better, expecialy for water resistance).

Good performance for everyday use (media consumption, navigating the obscures alleys of the internet, and stuff) and sometime some light gaming (stuff that could be ran on a broken microwave).

The rear camera, is something important enough, and i would love to have something that doesnt need a good 3-4 seconds to actualy take the photo, with the higher megapixel camera, but it doesnt necessarly need to be a cameraphone, because i mostly take photos of cats, and cool cars i see on the road while walking.

For stuff like wireless charging, charging speed, screen size, it doesnt really matters a lot, because i will get  used to it, except wireless charging, thats 110% an optional (never had it in a phone, so i'm not used to having it). Also if the bezels are thick, thats not an issue, since i always use a cover, so that mitigates the thick bezels

Also i would like to be able to use the phone without issues (as much as possible) for 4-6 years.

I'm open to pretty much any brand, except apple, since i'm too used to android.

My last phones were Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro and Xiaomi mi 11 lite 5G. I need ultra-low power mode support like my Redmi Note 9 pro. I use it when going to the wilderness for extended periods. I could get up to 7 days of battery life in ULP mode and used the phone for occasional GPS and offline map checking. So my main focus is on battery life. I'm happy with Xiaomi, but would like a better camera, so I was thinking about alternatives. I know that Samsung phones have similar ULP modes but I couldn't find any test to find out how power-efficient their implementation is. So I came here looking for some experience with Ultra-low power modes with different manufacturers (Don't know where to find this info). The phone must have 2 SIM slots and ideally a MicroSD slot (I know that this is almost impossible with modern phones) but my Redmi Note 9 checked this box.

post,1i6om5h,smartphones,Vivo x200 vs One plus 13 vs Oppo Find x8 Pro vs Other Options,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been using my Samsung S21 Ultra for the last two years, and I’ve really enjoyed it. However, I’m starting to think about upgrading to a more complete phone that better suits my daily needs.

I’m looking for a phone that excels in:

* **Photography:** Taking good pictures (including selfies and videos).
* **Productivity:** AI tools, reminders, and assistant features.
* **Multitasking:** Smooth performance and strong connectivity for daily tasks.
* **Social Media:** Seamless usage and multitasking with apps.

I’ve mostly used Samsung phones throughout my life, with a brief three-year stint with an iPhone. While the iPhone camera was fantastic, I felt limited by some of its functionality. My S21 Ultra has been great for multitasking and productivity, but the camera occasionally underperforms.

After doing some research, I’ve narrowed my options to three phones, but I’d love some opinions:

# 1. Vivo X200

* I’ve heard great things about its camera, but I can’t find much information about how it performs in day-to-day use.
* I’m also curious about its software experience, long-term durability, and whether it’s comfortable to use (considering the size of the camera module).

# 2. OnePlus 13

* It seems like a solid and durable phone, with 6 years of software updates and great battery life.
* However, I’ve seen mixed reviews about the camera—especially the selfie and video quality.
* I also couldn’t find much about its AI tools, which is something I’m interested in.

# 3. Oppo Find X8 Pro

* This phone has caught my attention for its AI capabilities and design.
* I couldn’t find much reliable info on its battery performance or detailed software experience.

I’d really appreciate any feedback on these phones, especially regarding daily use, software, durability, and cameras. If you have experience with any of them, I’d love to hear about it!

I’m also open to other suggestions, so if you think there’s a better option out there—whether it’s Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei, or something else—please share your thoughts.

However the endless choices available from different brands make picking a successor quite the difficult task.

I basically rounded my options down to these phones : 
-google pixel 8 ( kinda skeptical because of the weak battery life especially down the line and the subpar performance ) 

- oneplus 12r ( cheapest of the bunch. Sublime screen , undying battery life and all the speedy stuff but mediocre camera... especially no telephoto lens) 

- realme gt6 ( honestly no idea about this besides it resembles the OP12r.) 

-honor 200 pro ( afaik good camera and screen , but mediocre software and lackluster battery and thermals ) 

-finally xiaomi 14t pro (or 14) ( thermal issues also hyperos making it quite difficult also almost as expansive as the oneplus 12, altho the op 12 is a slightly used pristine condition with no box kind of deal) 

So i wanna know if possible is the camera on the op that bad ? Or will it be just fine ( i don't need a cutting edge camera just a consistent point and shoot camera to keep memories and stuff )  is the realme worth the extra money for the ''better camera'' ? Is there anyother difference between realme and op ? 
And finally is the pixel battery that bad ? And does it have any real advantage on the others beside 7yo software support.
Should i just save up more and go straight for the oneplus 12 ?

post,1hnbha6,smartphones,My Tech Journey between Apple and Android and where to go next,"Hey everyone,

I've always been seen as an Apple fanboy by my friends, even though, for over a year, I barely had any Apple devices at home. Indeed, lately, I've been exploring Android phones, especially foldables, which have really caught my interest. I tried the S24 Ultra briefly but switched back to the Z Fold 6. Now, I have the Honor Magic V3, the first foldable that doesn't feel like a compromise in size. However, there are still some trade-offs, particularly in terms of software and photography. 

Then, I have started to wonder whether those trade offs are worth it and whether I would not be better off with a more ""dedicated"" slab device with a big screen. Indeed, I consume quite a bit of content on my phone, such as YT videos and I read a lot of PDFs, for which the Honor is great vs a regular slab phone; however, most of the time, I need to annotate or highlight the pdf which is not optimal. As to YT videos, the square format of the Magic V3 makes it that I don't think the video is actually much larger than it would be on an iPhone. Hence, I have the impression that most of the time I would be better served with a combo of the Ipad mini (for instance) and the iPhone. The counterpart is that I always have my phone with me and that would not be the case with the iPad mini.

Anyway, the thing is, when the iPad Pro M4 came out and then the MacBook Pro M4, I made the plunge. Having an iPad and a MacBook Pro again has reignited my interest in Apple. Despite the Galaxy Watch 7 being quite decent, nothing beats the Apple Watch, and the Apple ecosystem remains unmatched in performance. I tried immersing myself in Samsung's ecosystem with a laptop, phone, tablet, and buds, but it just wasn't the same. In addition, I find that there are just more quality accessories for the iPhone than for any other phone and a lot of apps are usually better optimized on iPhones (maybe this is truer for tablets actually). There is also more content online for iPhones. For instance, I use an app called Notion and there are a lot of videos suggesting interesting shortcuts to speed up data entry, and this is just one example

As such, I'm considering the iPhone Pro 16 Max, but I'm hesitant because of the allure of regular Android innovations. Financially, it would probably be wise to change phones less frequently, and with iPhones, there's only one model a year anyhow, which limits temptation :-) Still, would I be able to wait close to a full year without wanting to try something new ? I know that if I go back to iphones, I cannot expect a lot of innovations over time and that this will mostly be incremental changes.

Also, as I didn't get the iPhone 15, and my time with the iPhone 14 was brief, I realized it's been a while since I had an iPhone as my main device, and I have really come to enjoy some Android features like advanced notifications and multitasking. Losing these could be a downside. I'm also interested in AI, but what I really want is a personal assistant (that would simplify my day to day life), which still seems far off with any brand.

I guess the wisest thing to do would be to wait for the S25 Ultra announcement to see what it offers.

What are your thoughts? Have any of you faced a similar dilemma?

As an aside, if that may be of interest to anyone, I have trained Notebook LLM with about 30 sources (mostly reddit and youtube videos) to provide a summary of the pros and cons of the Iphone 16 PM and the S24U:

**iPhone 16 Pro Max: Improvements, Strengths, and Weaknesses**

* **Display:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch LTPO AMOLED display with 460 pixels per inch (ppi) and a peak brightness of 2000 nits. It offers a 91.4% screen-to-body ratio, resulting in thinner borders. However, the camera cutout on the display is a notable interruption. While the display is excellent, it does not have the anti-reflective properties of the Samsung S24 Ultra.
* **Performance:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max is powered by the A18 Bionic chip, built on a 3nm process, leading to better efficiency and performance. It has 8GB of RAM. In benchmarks, the A18 Pro chip shows significantly higher single and multi-core performance than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the S24 Ultra. In real-world usage, both phones feel equally snappy.
* **Battery:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 5.5% larger battery than the previous model, with a capacity of around 4,568 mAh. It has improved battery efficiency due to optimized software and hardware. The battery life is generally considered very good, often lasting a full day with normal usage. It supports 45W wired and 15W wireless charging, but does not have reverse wireless charging. Wireless charging can be finicky, and may require an Apple charger. The charging speed is slower than the S24 Ultra.
* **Camera:** The primary camera is 48 megapixels (MP), with a larger sensor and pixel size. The iPhone has excellent video recording capabilities. The iPhone uses a 12MP sensor for the Periscope zoom, while the S24 Ultra uses a 50MP sensor. The iPhone's ultrawide camera is 48 MP, while the S24 Ultra uses a 12 MP sensor. While the camera generally takes better photos, some note the Samsung's camera is superior in certain conditions such as low light. The new camera control button is described as ""pointless and gimmicky"" and ""flawed,"" with its accuracy being ""horrific"". The software is still in development for the button.
* **Software:** The device has Apple Intelligence, which includes features like notification summaries, text proofreading, and the ability to summarize emails and notes. Siri has been enhanced with the ability to type to it. However, some of these features are not fully reliable. The device also offers iMovie, Garage Band, iMessage, and Apple Wallet. The predictive text on the keyboard works very well.
* **Weaknesses:** The most significant weaknesses of the iPhone 16 Pro Max are its new camera control button, which is largely seen as a failed experiment, the fact that it runs hotter than other phones, and the thermal throttling where the performance takes a dive right after one minute of intense use. The lack of reverse wireless charging is also a minor disadvantage. The notes app on the Apple ecosystem is significantly better than what Android offers.

**Design and Build:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max features a refined design, inheriting the style from previous models but with a more futuristic and elegant look. It has glass on the back and front, with stainless steel sides. The design is ergonomic and well-balanced. While some find the iPhone design to be stagnant, the 16 Pro Max introduces some changes to the exterior, making it feel fresh. The device is also durable with a ""Frosty glass"" back that hides damage, and the matte titanium sides do not show fingerprints easily. It maintains IP68 water and dust resistance.

**Detailed Comparison: iPhone 16 Pro Max vs Samsung S24 Ultra**

* **Display:** The S24 Ultra display is slightly smaller at 6.8 inches with 505 ppi, which makes it more pixel-dense than the iPhone’s display, and is also brighter at 2,500 nits. The S24 Ultra's screen-to-body ratio is lower at 88.5%. The S24 Ultra has a unique Corning Gorilla Armor glass that reduces reflections in direct sunlight, a feature not found on the iPhone.
* **Performance:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max, with its A18 chip, generally outperforms the S24 Ultra in benchmarks. However, real-world performance is comparable. The S24 Ultra has 12 GB of RAM compared to the iPhone's 8 GB. The iPhone has better stability in stress tests compared to the S24 Ultra.
* **Battery and Charging:** The S24 Ultra has a larger 5,000 mAh battery and supports 45W wired and 15W wireless charging, with reverse wireless charging at 4.5W. The S24 Ultra charges to 65% in 30 minutes, while the iPhone charges to 50% in 30 minutes. The Samsung charges faster overall. Despite having a smaller battery, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a slightly longer battery life during normal use.
* **Cameras:** The S24 Ultra has a 200MP primary camera, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 48MP primary camera. The Samsung has a higher digital zoom capability, reaching 100x. While the Samsung has larger sensors on the Periscope zoom lens and the ultrawide lens, the iPhone utilizes larger pixels. The iPhone's photo and video quality is generally seen as slightly better. The Samsung has more camera options including 8K video, Director's View, and Expert RAW.
* **Software:** The iPhone runs on iOS, while the S24 Ultra runs on Android. The user experience is a matter of preference, with iOS being known for stability and intuitiveness. Android has more flexibility and customization. Samsung has features like DeX, which allows for a PC-like experience. Both offer similar AI features such as photo editing, image generation, and text summarization. The iPhone uses chatGPT to answer questions and the S24 Ultra uses Bixby. The iPhone has a smoother autocorrect, but the Samsung has more AI tools built in. Samsung offers 7 years of software updates, while Apple offers at least 5.
* **Design and Durability:** The S24 Ultra has a more angular design with titanium, and is heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The S24 Ultra has better screen protection, with the Corning Gorilla Armor glass.
* **Unique Features:** The Samsung S24 Ultra has the S Pen stylus, wireless power share and can turn into a fully functional PC with Samsung Dex. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has the action button and the camera button. The iPhone also has emergency SOS.

**Price:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max is priced at around £1,199/$1,199. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra has a higher launch price of £1,249/$1,299. The Samsung often has offers available, making the price more competitive. Android devices typically depreciate faster than iPhones.

**Comparison: iPhone 16 Pro Max vs. Pixel 9 Pro XL**

* **AI:** The Pixel phones are known for their strong AI implementation, which includes features like Gemini Live and impressive generative AI tools.
* **Camera:** The Pixel phones are often praised for the camera quality.
* **Software and User Experience:** The Pixel devices offer a different Android user experience than Samsung devices. They often use a ""pure"" Android, with less manufacturer customization. The Pixel devices have fewer pre-installed apps and bloatware compared to some other Android devices.

**No Specific Details:** The provided sources do not contain detailed comparisons between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but some sources suggest that the Pixel 9 Pro XL has some advancements over the iPhone 16 Pro Max, particularly in software and AI capabilities. The video mentions that the Pixel often has better AI integration than both Samsung and Apple.

**Apple Ecosystem vs. Android Ecosystem**

* **Android Ecosystem:** The Android ecosystem is known for its flexibility, wide range of options, and customization. The ecosystem has a broad range of devices, including phones, watches, earbuds, tablets, laptops, TVs, and home appliances. Samsung and Google are the two main competitors, each providing comparable features to Apple. The Android ecosystem often offers more diverse hardware options, including foldable and flip phones. The ecosystem is often more open and allows for more options for third-party software. This open system can lead to some inconsistencies and fragmentation. The various manufacturers and their customizations may create confusion amongst users.
* **AI:** Android has a clear advantage in AI capabilities and its implementations are further along than Apple’s. Apple's AI focus is on privacy and on-device processing. Android’s AI, from the likes of Google and Samsung, use more advanced server-based processing, with potential questions around privacy.
* **Business Models:** Apple's business model focuses on selling hardware and services, keeping users within their ecosystem. Google’s Android business model is based around advertising; the company aims to collect user information in order to better target advertisements. Samsung aims to sell products and technology to both users and to other manufacturers.

**Apple Ecosystem:** Apple's ecosystem is known for its seamless integration across devices. It provides a consistent user experience and ease of use. Apple controls both hardware and software, which allows for better optimization and integration. Key features include AirDrop, iMessage, FaceTime, and the ability to use an iPad as a second screen for a Mac. The ecosystem includes the iPhone, AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBook. The ecosystem provides a reliable and stable experience with minimal crashes or slowdowns. The ecosystem’s tight control over its products and software can be seen as both an advantage and a disadvantage; while it promotes a seamless experience it also reduces the amount of customization available to users.

**Conclusion** The choice between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and its Android competitors depends heavily on individual priorities. If a user values simplicity, stability, and seamless ecosystem integration, the iPhone may be the best option. If a user prioritizes customization, flexibility, a wide variety of options, or AI integration, an Android device might be more suitable. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has improved battery life, maintains top-notch photo and video quality, and offers excellent ecosystem integration. However, it faces strong competition from Android models that offer innovation and better performance in certain areas. The advancements in AI technology are becoming increasingly more relevant, and this could lead to a major shift in the years to come.",2024-12-27 09:41:00,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1hnbha6/my_tech_journey_between_apple_and_android_and/,"camera, battery, design, display, performance, price",14 Ultra,Lillumultipass99,0.83
post,1h5z2np,smartphones,Razr 2024: a great phone at a great price.,"Hey all! I've been testing the Moto Razr 2024 for a couple weeks now and I have to say, it's a fantastic phone, especially for less than $500 in many places. I wasn't sure how to feel about it at the start, but I have grown to really like it. 

The displays are awesome. The outside screen is way bigger than last year and is really nice to have. Meanwhile, the 6.9 inch 1080p OLED on the inside is more than good enough for basically all tasks. Both screens are sharp, vivid, and responsive due to the high refresh rate (90hz on the outside screen, 120 on the inside screen).

The specs are midrange as the pricetag would suggest. The Razr 2024 is powered by the Mediatek Dimensity 7300X, which is great for standard tasks. It scores a little bit over half of the score that my Galaxy S23 Ultra did, and that translates to basically no slowdowns in real world performance. 

Battery life is stellar. I was worried about it, but it's amazing in my experience. I get through a full day of heavy usage with about 30% left, and I have never killed it in a day. 

The software is classic Motorola, with very close to stock Android 14. With that, Motorola promises 3 years of software updates, although they're historically very slow at delivering the updates. 

The cameras are pretty good for a midrange smartphone. The photos produced are detailed and pretty contrasty. However, it's a little bit inconsistent. You can definitely get great photos though, and it's not a reason to not buy this phone.

Overall, the Razr 2024 is a solid phone, especially if you can get it for less than retail. Originally retailing for $699, I've seen it for $400, $350, even $200. That's a great deal.

post,1fm5vqr,smartphones,"Should I buy an iPhone 16 Pro, Samsung S24 Ultra or S25 Ultra","Hey everyone,

I'm thinking of changing my phone for Christmas and I'm hesitating between an iPhone 16 Pro, Samsung S24 Ultra or S25 Ultra when it'll be released.

I am usually an Apple & iPhone fan, and currently own an iPhone 14, but here's the thing : I recently bought a Samsung laptop and a Samsung tablet for work, so it feels logical to also switch to a Samsung phone to be able to access my files from any device. Even in terms of performance you get much more your money's worth with a Galaxy. However, I don't really like the Android OS and UI, and I prefer the design of the iPhone. I also wanted to buy an Apple Watch and HomePod, which is a little compromised if I get a Galaxy S24 Ultra or S25 Ultra. It also limits the features of my AirPods Pro 2, which I'm very satisfied of and don't want to change.

Here's the question, which one of these phones should I get ? Will the S25 Ultra be released soon after Christmas ?

Currently toss up between iphone 16 pro max and galaxy s24 ultra 

I've used both Apple and Samsung in past but do have a softspot for the galaxy as most people I know and family members have iphones and I like to be different.

But I do like the iPhone refinement and reliability, and it's just easy to use.

Haven't got any thing else ie iPad or tablet or watche 

But currently I'm with ee, and with the galaxy s24u currently on offer for a little under £800 and with a free galaxy watch 7 so works out £52 pm with unlimited data 

Same package with ee but with iphoke and it's £70.99 pm obvs without a watch etc 

Is it really worth the extra £20 per month 

I know the s25u is round the corner but obvs that'll end up the same price as the iPhone when first comes out if not more. 

Not really got a preference on os but do like the look of the new iPhone albeit in usage probably isn't any different to my 14 pro max just don't want go back to iPhone and regret it 🙈",2024-11-20 17:55:11,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1gvvl84/new_phone/,price,14 Ultra,Long-Laugh-6904,1.0
post,1ftgc00,smartphones,Which phone is better? ,"Really here to talk quality with price. They're all almost pretty similar in price to each other... so I wanna know.
I've been an Android user my entire life, because it's always been a phone that I feel more comfortable using and it's customizing features are just amazing. But, in today's world if you do not have an iphone or one of the latest overpriced phones that cannot be judged... you don't fit in. those are the 4 phones I was thinking of getting:
-  Iphone 14 pro max (14, because I don't see a difference between the 14 and 15 other than the price...)
- Samsung Galaxy Z flip 6 
- Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra 
- Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra  (Same thing with 23 and 24, the only difference is mainly the price...but still. ) 

which is better honestly? 
I know each one has it's downside for example the Z flip's crease would get worse over the years and I'm not somebody who buys a phone every year... the phone that I'm typing this post with been in my hands for 3 almost 4 years it's a note 10, i need a change.  
The S23 and S24 design isn't really it for me like I said I been using a note 10 which is square as well but smaller and the camera is different. Im just afraid that it would feel like I didn't really make a change. 
and For iphone, I'm just not used to using them and they're pretty limited...the lack of features that I would miss from an Android would give me a hit. Honestly only getting it bc everyone has an iphone these days and the design looks cooler.

post,1fm382k,smartphones,Early Upgrade Plans - Worth it?,"Hi all, first post here. I currently have an IPhone 12 and its pretty worn down. Physically, the phone is in great condition - I actually love the 12 largely because its the tankiest IPhone I've ever had. Its performance has dipped dramatically over the last \~1 1/2 years though, especially with the battery. All of this said, I'm interested in getting a new phone. Currently I'm \~70% sure that I'll stick with Apple just cuz its what I'm used to, but the Galaxy S24 Ultra & new Pixel stuff is interesting too. The Samsung largely interests me because back in the day (when I had an IPhone 4s) I was obsessed with the Galaxy Note 5. It seems like it'd be a nice change of pace.

Okay, back on track - obviously the IPhone 16/Pro/Max phones dropped, and they seem solid. However, I'm just not really excited about it. Not sure if this is common sentiment, but it feels like Apple has become complacent and isn't really innovating anymore - at least not from a hardware point of view. Other manufacturers offer folding displays, Samsung has the S Pen, its stuff thats not necessary but still exciting. 

All of this said, I'm wary about going all-in on a 16 series IPhone because it just feels like there's bound to be a big release for the 17 or 18 in a year or two. I know at least some major carriers offer plans to upgrade each year, but I can't find clear details on how they work. Does anybody have experience with these plans & have an opinion as to whether they're worth it or not? I'm not sure if I should just gut it out with the 12 or get an upgrade to something like a 14 as a holdover.

post,1d0ejj6,smartphones,"S23, S23+, or IPhone 14?","hello! need help making a decision 

i've had my current phone, a samsung note FE, since 2018. before it, i only owned a samsung 4 for nearly four or five years, and a nokia in my childhood. needless to say, i am not a tech savvy person. 

i've managed to scrounge up a budget of $666 - $800 (american; converted it from my country's currency). the local electronics store also has a mega sale for the week. 

after taking a look at their catalogue, i've narrowed down my options to: 

1) a base samsung 23 (256 GB) / cost = $533
2) a samsung 23+ (256 GB) / cost = $533
3) a base iphone 14 (128 GB) / cost = $680 

i've read about the pros, the cons, the ups and downs, and i still can't make a decision. the S23 series seems to be the best of the samsung collection at the moment, and while the ultra version has clear perks, it is WAY too big for me; i've got joint problems in my right arm (and i don't really like the corners, either), so that's why i'm looking at the other versions instead. i really like the base's size, but considering the plus comes with a few more perks at the same price, i've been thinking to just tolerate my joint pain. would it be worth it? 

as for the iphone 14, the main reason i'm considering it is perhaps a bit shallow: all my closest friends have an iphone, and it lets them connect with each other so much more, and i've always felt excluded from the party (since, like, middle school). plus, the camera-quality. i'm no pro-photographer, but i do love taking pictures. however, as someone who's only ever owned andriods, i'm a bit anxious about the jump. is it easier than expected? 

mostly i just want a brand new phone that's worth its price, that WILL last me a few years, with a great camera. thoughts and tips?",2024-05-25 15:31:43,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1d0ejj6/s23_s23_or_iphone_14/,"camera, price",14 Ultra,throwawayheart333,1.0

post,1cand6d,smartphones,Review of Motorola Edge 50 Ultra,"Exactly that's what I mean. The Motorola Edge 50 Ultra launched last week and that phone is definitely Motorola's ace in the hole, their flagship device of 2024. The Motorola Edge 50 Ultra, is for the android person who is sick and tired hearing all the hype over the 3 flagship phones of the Samsung Galaxy S Series. Everyone knows that Samsung, and Apple as well, launch their flagship device series at the same time every year. The Samsung Galaxy S series has 3 variants which are the S, S+, and the flagship S Ultra. As for Apple they have the regular iPhone, iPhone Plus, iPhone Pro, and the iPhone Pro Max which actually makes 4 not 3. I do apologize for that small miscalculation.   

The annual launch of the Google Pixel flagship series phones became interesting again in October of 2021 when the newly designed all new Pixel 6 series came out Google decided to take their smartphone game to the next level and start producing their own, in house, chipsets instead of using chips made by Qualcomm and Mediatek, which most Chinese android smartphone manufacturers primarily use. I started to get excited when I heard this news, but as we know starting your own SOC chipset is going to have its speed bumps. For example Samsung manufacturer their own chipset called the Samsung Exynos chips. Samsung Enxyos chipsets are only available on Samsung devices. Samsung makes the Exynos chips for it's own devices launched around the world. However in the USA Samsung goes with the Snapdragon 8 Series SOC for their S Series lineup. Exynos has always been outperformed by the Snapdragon chipset, but its getting better and better every year albeit so is Snapdragon's chipset. The Exynos 2400 comes closer to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, than it ever has before. Recently there was a rumor going around the android communtiy that testing of the Samsung Exynos 2500 was taking place and it was supposedly outperforming the early results of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SOC. Both of these chipsets are expected to be released in the last quarter of 2024, and they are going to be extremely fast, vibrant, and smooth with quite amazing battery efficency. Sorry I went on a tangent there lol The Motorola Edge 50 Ultra is also for the person who won't join the darkside and go over to the world of Apple. The person who has had a Oneplus, ZTE, and even an LG smartphone in the past and is familiar with each company's custom android skin and it's launcher/software. An example of which would be like Oxygen OS is what Oneplus uses and Hello UI is what the Motorola Edge 50 Ultra uses and it's Motorola 's brand new UI as well. My experience testing this device went extremely well and I am highly impressed with the Motorola Edge 50 Ultra. It is an amazing flagship device that is definitely Motorola's best handset in the last decade.  The Edge 50 Ultra is the first Motorola flagship phone to have a 1.5K resolution display which is enabled with a refresh rate of 144hz. The phone can reach 2500 nits of peak brightness and can be easily seen outside in the direct sunshine. There was absolutely no problem viewing the content on the display in my time with it. The camera hardware is the best triple lens setup on a Motorola flagship device. It has a 50MP primary lens that is capable of shooting excellent detail with great depth of field. Thanks to Motorola's new advanced AI camera system is certified by Pantone to be color accurate and the display is also Pantone certified as well especially when it comes to natural skintones. The AI camera processing is spectacular and really do an excellent job of reducing any noise in the photos and it had the perfect amount of saturation in the details without going overboard most of the time. The Telephoto lens is magnificent and has an excellent optical zoom of 3X. Any photos taken from 10X and under will lose barely any detail at all thanks to the new AI software. The 50MP Ultrawide lens is also a great camera that produces some of the best ultra wide shots I have personally ever seen on a smartphone. The all new Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 is a fantastic beast of a processor and chugs away effortlessly even when multi tasking for hours. There is absolutely nothing you can throw at this processor that can challenge it in the slightest. Absolutely amazing heat control as well. After gaming for over 45 minutes straight the phone didn't get too hot at all just slightly warm around the rear camera bump. My 1 and only gripe with this phone is the size of the battery in this flagship device. Motorola put in a 4500 mAh battery into this phone when a 5000 mAh battery is more so the average size of any flagship device. They did have the decency to include up to 125W TurboPower charging whovh powers up the phone from dead to full in a mere 36 minutes. Unfortunately in the USA we can only charge devices as high as 80W due to the sockets themselves in the country not having the ability to produce anything higher than 80W. At least Motorola even includes the ability to use wireless charging at up to 50W, and it can even reverse charge at 10W! This more than makes up for the inclusion of a 4500 mAh battery even though last year the Edge 40 Pro had a 4800 mAh battery so that means a reduction in size of 300 mAh. After spending time reviewing the Edge 50 Ultra the battery lasted me st least the whole day if not more with a single charge, which definitely works for me.

SPECS: 

DISPLAY: The Motorola Edge 50 Ultra has a 6.7"" Super HD or 1.5K resolution. The screen has a 20:8 aspect ratio. Super HD (2712p x 1220p) It has a 446ppi and a peak brightness of 2500 nits.  PROCESSOR: Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 Mobile Platform with 12GB or 16GB of RAM.  You have storage options of 512GB ROM or 1TB ROM. It also runs on android 14 with the new Hello UI from Motorola.  CAMERA: It has a 50MP primary lens with f/1.6, 50MP Ultra Wide lens, and finally a 64MP Telephoto camera with 3X Optical Zoom with f/2.4. It also has a front facing 50MP Selfie lens with f/1.9.  BATTERY: It has a 4500mAh battery with 125W TurboPower charging and up to 50W wireless charging, and 10W reverse charging capabilities. AVAILABLE COLORS: Forest Gray(vegan leather) Peach Fuzz(vegan leather) Nordic Wood(actual wood)

I highly recommend this phone if you are in the market for a new flagship and you have a budget of up to $1100. It is going to be released, some time in the summer of 2024, in the United States. It will be renamed the Motorola Edge Plus 2024 when it launches in the US. Considering you can't get many other smartphones from brands in China when you are living in the United States; then there are only a few choices of what else is available in the North American smartphone market to purchase as your daily driver. The only other 3 phones that I would consider along with the Motorola Edge Plus 2024 would be the Oneplus 12, Asus Zenfone Ultra, and the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra.

post,1cxorrf,smartphones,Want to buy a new phone (budget 600-800€),"Hi.

I've owned the OnePlus 8 Pro for 4 years now and I was feeling a change as I cracked the screen again and it's not worth changing. Very happy with it. 

I had a good look at OnePlus 12 and it seems to be a great option with the new 8.3, but was wondering what other options to consider. I'd rather the screen wasn't curved.

Important factors: cameras and gaming performance.

post,1b0rrp7,Android,Xiaomi 14 Ultra's Incredible Camera Hardware Setup - By a Camera Nerd,"I am a camera geek, I own mirrorless cameras and DSLRs and I love talking about image sensors and the various image processing techniques. The 14 Ultra’s camera sensor stack and the lens array is simply incredible.

# SONY LYT-900 1 inch Sensor!

Let’s start with the main sensor which is the -> **1 inch Sony LYT-900** 50MP sensor and Xiaomi has paired it with a **lens going as wide as f1.63**. To put things in perspective as far as I know the Mi14 Ultra is the closest camera device to the old **Panasonic LX10 point and shoot camera** which featured a 20MP 1 Inch sensor paired with a 24-70 lens that went as wide as f1.4. I swear to God I think many years later, it’s a phone that has **come close to the Panasonic LX10’s sensor-lens combo at this size**!

I can only imagine how good the **RAW** images would be from the 14 Ultra - natural details, micro-contrast, shallow depth of field and wide dynamic range to push and pull in post.

# DUAL NATIVE ISO!!? 14 Stops of Dynamic Range!!

Not only is the sensor large and is paired with a wide aperture lens, the sensor itself features **dual native iso**. I was genuinely shocked to this on the spec sheet, as this is proper full frame mirrorless camera sensor stuff. You’ll see **dual native iso** on premium cameras like the **Panasonic S1H, Sony A7SIII, Canon EOS R5C** etc. Dual native ISO greatly helps in achieving good dynamic range even at a higher ISO level, because you now have **two base ISO levels**, one will be your lower and the other will be higher - and **at both these levels you’ll get the best dynamic range and noise performance** when shooting videos.

*Xiaomi claims that with this technology they are* ***able to achieve 14 stops of dynamic range -*** A bit much? :P Software tricks involved in this? I have only seen high end FF Sensors achieving this only at base ISO.

# PROPER SECONDARY SENSORS/LENSES - Sony IMX 855:

Xiaomi is using the same very good **Sony IMX 855 1/2.5 inch 50 MP** sensor for its ultra wide and dual telephoto lenses. The Ultrawide features a **12mm** full frame equivalent lens with an **f1.8** aperture.

The 3.2x telephoto features a **75mm** full frame equivalent lens also with the widest aperture in the flagship scene for a telephoto i.e **f1.8** and it also features **OIS**.

Finally the 5x telephoto is also no slouch, featuring a **120mm** full frame equivalent lens with a very impressive **f2.5** aperture with **OIS**.

This means that apart from the main sensor, the other focal lengths will not degrade your image or video quality by all that much - giving you incredible versatility.

# INNOVATIVE MOBILE LENS DESIGN:

Apart from the sensor, a word of appreciation on the lenses associated with them. Not only do all the lenses feature very wide maximum aperture, they also have **extremely close minimum focussing distance** allowing you to shoot incredible looking **macro shots with all the lenses**. We have seen how good the 4.3x optical zoom macros look out of the Vivo X100 Pro, the 14 Ultra just gives you even more options!!

The main sensor lens also features a **stepless aperture from f1.63 to f4**, which means if you are shooting close ups with the main sensor, you can choose how much of the image you want in focus by changing between the various aperture options. F4 aperture may also be suitable for shooting landscapes where you want the maximum corner to corner sharpness.

# VIDEO SPECS GALLORE!! 10 Bit LOG to DOLBY VISION HDR:

Main sensor capable of shooting **10 Bit LOG** Rec.2020 (not sure on max resolution/framerate) taking advantage of that dual native iso and 14 stops of dynamic range, **RAW Video** (not sure on container) and **Dolby Vision HDR**. Regular 8-Bit video upto **4K120** and 8K30.

Need I say more? Yes! ***All sensors capable upto 8K30***.

Conclusion:

 This is one device that truly deserves the ULTRA moniker in my opinion(Honorary mention - Vivo X100 Pro). As a tech fan it’s refreshing to see the boundaries of hardware getting pushed a big way once again! Hoping for other OEMs to follow suit!!

post,1bcevcq,Android,Xiaomi 14 Pro is an extremely underrated phone.,"I sell phones as a little side hustle and get to try all the top Flagships in the United States. So far I have used the S24 Ultra, iPhone 15 pro Max and the Google Pixel 8 Pro. I recently purchased a Xiaomi 14 Pro running the Xiaomi EU Rom and I was blown away! I actually preferred it over the S24 Ultra and decided to sell it. It's Display was on par with all 3 of those phones if not better. The software was actually more smooth than all the other phones which surprised me. You can purchase them brand new for around 700$ and flash the EU Room to make it run like a global rom.

post,1hsnnli,Android,"One of the areas that is often overlooked with modern smartphones that are equipped with bigger camera sensors is the quality of lenses, and the blur they produce","Quality of blur is a bit of a pet peeve of mine and I don't ever seem to see it mentioned by reviewers on YouTube, or even websites like GSMArena. 

Modern smartphones have bigger sensors, and when they focus up close, due to the nature of the sensor there is more area that is blurred. 

The presence of blur is not the issue, in fact it is welcomed; it helps create a more immersive photo with the ""3D"" effect. The issue is the quality of the blur itself. I don't know if modern smartphone manufacturers cannot correct for distortions, or simply don't care and use really low quality of lenses, but the blur modern smartphones produce looks awful. 

Here is an example: 

I took [this photo](https://i.postimg.cc/FmDcmQVn/67-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-01.jpg) with the Pixel 8a (top), and the Lumia 950 (bottom). Check how bad the blur looks in the top image. If you don't know what to look for, [take a look at this](https://i.postimg.cc/HHp5fLXy/68-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-02.jpg), where I point it out. 

I don't know what the correct photography term is for this phenomena, but I call it the ""evaporating blur"". It is when the blurred subject, letters in this case, look like they are duplicated, ghosted, and are evaporating. As if Thanos just snapped his fingers. 

The amount of blurring between the two phones is actually about the same, but the Lumia's blur is much more pleasant. 

I created [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1hjoimf/does_your_pixel_take_blurfree_pictures_of/) on r/GooglePixel recently where I asked if anybody else had issues taking blur-free photos of documents with their Pixels. The 8a has a bigger sensor than my previous 4a, and I was unpleasantly surprised when I found out that I cannot take decent photos of documents due to a distortion in the lens. Here is an additional comparison between [the 4a](https://i.postimg.cc/R4Q65vLz/19-Pixel-4a-Camera-PX-Automatic-mode.jpg), which does a much better job than the 8a, and [the Lumia 950](https://i.postimg.cc/mbhtHCfb/20-s-Xf-Qr-St.jpg). If you check the top and the bottom of the 4a's sample, you can see that evaporating blur effect. The 950 looks tack sharp, edge-to-edge. 

More examples: [The 4a](https://i.postimg.cc/mTLcTKm1/22-6osgj-C4.jpg), [The Lumia 950](https://i.postimg.cc/RM8qQh4w/23-qdp-RIJr.jpg). Take a look at the right side, the ""Phone camera direction"" text. 

One more example: [The Nokia 808 PureView](https://i.postimg.cc/1zNmY0sw-/25-in-Rt-T07.jpg), and [the 4a](https://i.postimg.cc/fTBR3T8t/24-l-HNs-K7d.jpg). You see how ""HERS"" in ""SKECHERS"" is being evaporated in the sample with the Pixel? 

It may look like I am nitpicking on the Pixels, but I am not, I am just a Pixel user and a fan, so I get to try them myself. All modern phones have this issue, at least I haven't come across one that had a truly nice blur. It's something I always pay attention to in reviews. [Here is an example with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra](https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/reviews/24/xiaomi-14-ultra/camera/gsmarena_1112.jpg), a premium camera flagship. Look at the right side of the image. [Another example](https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/reviews/24/vivo-x200-pro/camera/gsmarena_1107.jpg) with the vivo X200 Pro. 

iPhones have a very well known issue with [lens flares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXXZMoeoeE). It is because they use low quality lenses. It's something that is still not fixed. 

I am surprised how Nokia's engineers were able to tune their lenses 10 years ago, yet in the modern day, with these premium, super expensive camera centric smartphones we don't have that. 

The point of this thread is to just discuss if anybody else is also bothered by this, maybe I am the only one. What are your thoughts on it? Maybe I can bring awareness, so others know about it, and start to get annoyed by it too, LOL.",2025-01-03 14:28:37,351,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1hsnnli/one_of_the_areas_that_is_often_overlooked_with/,camera,Xiaomi 14 Ultra,DiplomatikEmunetey,0.92
post,1drlx1a,Android,Honor Magic6 Pro: Long-term Review,"Hi,

I thought I'd write this review if there's other people out there like me who were looking to invest in a new smartphone and wanted to see what people thought of the Honor Magic 6 Pro. Here's my opinion, which you're fine to ignore or enjoy.

For a full price handset of £1100, you should expect a handset that can compete with the best of today's phones. And the Honor Magic 6 Pro is up there with the best. 

Here's the obvious reasons why:
- Latest premium chipset (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3) with 12GB of RAM (+8GB Turbo Boost when needed), meaning fast and fluid performance including strong multi-tasking performance and fast responsive. I love Androids for their multi-tasking ability vs iPhones
- Premium, vibrant and large (6.8 inches) FHD+ (2800x1280) display, with accurate colours and enjoyable and comfortable viewing experience. Refresh rate up to 120Hz for buttery smooth scrolling that supposedly dials down to 1Hz when screen is idling to preserve battery, but I've yet to measure this. Can confirm the phone drops down to 60Hz when in ultra power saving mode
- Premium camera set up, including triple rear camera set up and selfie camera with 3D depth camera that takes rich, clear photos with lots of detail, especially in strong light conditions. Videos can be captured at up to 4K 60FPS on the rear camera and capture excellent quality videos with great colour and detail, especially on Movie Mode
- That front facing camera set up is the only one in the Android market that offers secure 3D Face Unlock like that of Face ID on iPhone which works in the dark and is also meets biometric security requirements for banking apps, Google Wallet etc.
- Excellent phone reception and sound quality/microphone pick up. No issues with signals or struggling to hear or be heard in phone calls. It has Voice over Wi-Fi (e.g. Wi-Fi calling) for those in a network that allow it, meaning if your base mobile phone reception is poor and struggle to get a signal, the network uses your Wi-Fi instead and the phone pics up that to maintain connectivity). It also has Voice Over LTE which uses 3/4/5G to boost your base voice call quality too
- In-screen fingerprint reader which I barely use because of the fast and secure Face Unlock
- Premium build and strong, curved front glass panel protection which make the phone feel premium. I unfortunately dropped this phone from about waist height face down onto a road surface and feared a shattered screen. Instead, all I got was a tiny chip in the corner of the panel that I forget is there as it's so small and of sight
- Loud, clear, and balanced speaker set up which if you're the person who likes to listen to music without earphones won't get annoyed at the down firing speaker being covered by your hand, muffling your sound
- Fast wired charging (80W, but no charger supplied), however with my current 40W charger it takes just under an hour to fully charge
- Speaking of battery, easily two full days on a full charge, which I think is improving as the phone learns my useage behaviour
- While Samsung S24 series have ""circle to search"", the Honor series have this too. You draw a circle on the image you want to search with your knuckle and drag it to the edge of the screen where it can then be searched in Google. Works all the time and is pretty accurate in identifying the image
- Familiar software experience if coming from a Huawei phone (I upgraded from Huawei Mate 20 Pro)
- Has a Desktop mode (like Samsung DeX but this was also on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro), which is capable of turning the phone into a mobile PC and works brilliantly (I forgot my laptop once and this saved the day for me as I was able to engage this mode and plug into my desk monitor, keyboard and mouse with a USB C hub
- Genuinely useful one handed mode (same as that on Huawei Mate 20 Pro)
- If you have existing Huawei or Honor technology e.g. laptops or earbuds, this works perfectly well with these (like an iPhone with a MacBook etc).
- Setup from Huawei Mate 20 Pro was easy- all apps and most settings including home screen folders and camera/picture folders were copied across in the same way with the apps and media in the right folders so it was like picking up from where I left off
- 4 years of Android OS updates (shipped with Android 14) and 5 years of monthly Android security updates (which have so far been regularly monthly and on the latest patch at time of writing)

However, here's the bits that could be better:
- It's massive, and it usually requires two hands to hold it with, even with one handed mode. Weight is top heavy because of that camera bump
- Camera bump is ugly and heavy, however with the right case equipped (I went first with the Official Honor Bracket Case first but have since opted for and stuck with a cler silicone case), the camera bump offers a decent ridge for your finger to rest on while holding the phone. The bump cause the phone to lean up when on a table so doesn't lie flat. Some might like that, but I don't. On the plus side, because it's big and central(ish) there's no wobble
- A couple of software bugs which I'm sure will get ironed out, including not being able to auto fill verification codes from SMS into Google Chrome, the QR code can't read FIDO barcodes. But I've never had any apps crash, close randomly, or just fail to open
- Aggressive power management of apps requires manual input on what apps you don't want it to shut down or launch automatically (same as Huawei experience, so new users might get a bit bogged down by this and wonder why emails and messages aren't coming through on time). On changing these settings, I rarely miss any notifications 
- Camera can sometimes overprocess colours and sharpness, but varies with individual's preferences. Don't bother with expecting much detail beyond 10x zoom, but 5x zoom in good lighting is exceptional. Video sometimes struggles with autofocusing on a moving subject but found Movie mode is much better at switching focus so tend to record with that.
- Magic Portal is mostly not very magical but has potential. Overall, I like the dragging of an image to the edge of the phone to share but you can't do it for any image on any app or screen your on, e.g. most 3rd party pages like BBC News through Chrome or Sky Sports, unless you highlight a bit of text first.
- Magic Capsule again is not very magical. Some people might find it obtrusive (I came from a Huawei Mate 20 Pro with a wide notch so it's an improvement from that in my opinion and a trade off for having that secure Face Unlock). Magic Capsule is alright for seeing and knowing what you're listening to e.g. on Audible or Deezer/Spotify, but my ears tell me that just as well. However, it's cool for if you've set a timer and can see how much time is remaining on the countdown, but bizarrely doesn't do the same when running the stop clock function, so you can't see how much time has elapsed
- Battery gets warm when charging. Battery life was poor to begin with but since some updates and learning my behaviour, this is now excellent, but could be something you might be disappointed with at the start. It gets better
- A phone this size and price should have a QHD+ display, like the Samsung S24 Ultra and Mate 20 Pro.
- Privacy features on Android 14 are overkill. I think it limits functionality overall
- Lack of charger and case in the box for this price feels a rip off, especially when the phone has 80W charging but you need a power brick capable of that to reach those speeds
-Lastly, I miss the notification LED that let me know I had a message without turning the screen on.

Overall, before landing on this handset I tried the iPhone 15 Pro (great hardware and handfeel, awful software experience), Samsung S24+, and the Xiaomi 14 (both of which were at best a side step from the ahead-of-its-time 2018 Huawei Mate 20 Pro that I was upgrading from, with the secure Face Unlock being an essential miss on both phones and more or less equivalent camera performance to the Mate 20 Pro). Coming from the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, this feels like the most natural successor albeit not without its quirks and individual taste preferences.

post,1e6es4z,Android,"Display Brightness, APL, and a reminder to not trust marketing","You might've noticed recently that some certain manufacturers have been advertising ridiculously high display brightness values, such as 4500 nits. You'd logically expect one of those phones to be visibly brighter than all the 2000 nit class phones, but in reality they are not.

The first reason for this is simply because your eyes do not perceive brightness linearly, however there's a more annoying second reason - all these manufacturers are borderline lying.

Just like how a ""120W fast charging"" phone only actually charges at 120W for just one or two minutes, some manufacturers are stuck in a numbers war, trying to claim the highest possible screen brightness number, whereas others are varying levels of honest.

The main reason for this is APL, or average picture level. This is dictated by the content being displayed. Think of a screen that's fully white - that's 100% APL A screen that's half white and half black has 50% APL , and a screen with just a few white letters on a black background might have 1% APL.

While APL didn't matter in the days of LCD displays where the backlight has to work just as hard regardless of the content being displayed, on modern OLED displays APL plays a big role in defining how much power a screen draws and how much heat it generates. As you can therefore imagine, the manufacturers claimed brightness figures are often measured at very low APL , which are almost never representative of real-life content.

One of the most egregious examples I've seen recently is the [Vivo X Fold3 Pro](https://www.vivo.com/en/products/x-fold3-pro). Vivo advertises 4500 nits peak brightness, but if you read their website (note 10) you'll see this is achieved at 1% APL whilst playing HDR video under outdoor sunlight, something that almost never happens in real life.

In practice if you look at a lab test such as DxOMark's [here](https://www.dxomark.com/vivo-x-fold3-pro-display-test/) which uses a more normal APL picture (unfortunately not disclosed by DxOMark but likely \~100% when cross-referencing other phones results), you can see that the Vivo X Fold3 delivers more or less the same brightness than the Galaxy Fold5, advertised at 1750 nits.

Another comparison is the Xiaomi 14 Ultra (advertised 3000 nits) vs. the Xperia 1 VI (advertised 1300 nits). When tested by gsmarena at 75% APL [here](https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_1_vi-review-2699p3.php), both delivered more or less the same brightness.

Now, do the Vivo Fold3 Pro and Xiaomi 14 Ultra have good screens? Yeah, of course they do, and they also do post impressive brightness numbers in when looking at certain content such as HDR video. Just don't expect anywhere near the advertised numbers in real life usage looking at a mostly white app in broad daylight, which is where you'd normally expect these brightness numbers to come in handy.

Next time you're comparing phones, just add ""display brightness"" to your list of numbers that you can't really compare across spec sheets, as it's been ruined by marketing (alongside charging wattage, camera megapixels, etc.). They give a vague indication of whether it's good or crap, but that's about it without checking a review's lab tests that's used the same image on all screens.",2024-07-18 15:49:58,35,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1e6es4z/display_brightness_apl_and_a_reminder_to_not/,"camera, display",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,pcman2000,0.86

post,1gwuhen,Android,"Short review: I have the Doogee S200 rugged which has an IR camera. What cool things can I capture with it, UFOs? Ghosts? Guide me...","https://preview.redd.it/uxtudx3ybc2e1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bf32f52c445335f788cb4f4cf41dc679e5758ad

I didn't actually know this was a thing until recently and got this phone added to the collection. Have not used it as a phone properly yet but part of my thinking is to really put the IR camera through its paces and figure out what its legitimate uses could be in the real world so am open to ideas.

Here it is in action at my workstation for ref: [https://i.imgur.com/1xz88qg.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/1xz88qg.mp4)

The IR emitters are in a pair config and seem to fire out a wide light that can illuminate a massively wide area so should be perfect outdoors too from initial impressions.

Initial impressions as a phone though, it's an absolute unit, my main phone is the S24 Ultra and it dwarfs that in thickness and heft. The 10,100 mAh battery seems endless too and performance of the Dimensity SoC seems on par with what is expected of a modern phone.

A 37W USB-PD/PPS compliant charger comes in the box, too which is nice to see, though sadly there is no Qi wireless charging featured.

There is a side-mounted fingerprint scanner on the power button like on old Sony phones which seems to work well, it can also have gestures enabled to it like touch and hold to open task switcher and stuff.

It is rated to IP69K which means high pressure water and dust cannot ingress the housing and Doogee market it as an ""underwater camera"" as well.

The OS is clean like stock Android with no extra bloat other than some toolbag apps like height measure, protector, compass etc. The rest are all Google stock apps. It ships with Android 14 for ref.

My only gripe is the LCD panel isn't really the most pleasing to the eyes. Years of being used to OLED everything and having to read and look at an LCD really makes it look outdated lol.

The touchscreen on the back seems a bit of a gimmick so I just put some memes on it for now, can be a clock, notifications, music player etc though if needed though you cannot put GIFs or videos on it, only images.

Only one speaker, so sound is obviously a bit rubbish, but you aren't buying a rugged phone for its music playback capabilities, though it does have an FM radio...

SD card slot features which is nice to see, no headphone jack, no IR blaster.

The USB\_C port is only 2.0 specification, so don't expect lightning speed transfers to PC if recording masses of videos.

The camera quality seems fine for the 100MP main sensor, against my S24 Ultra's 200MP shots it stacks better in fact as the exposure balance is better controlled, though the default 12MP mode on the 24 Ultra is obviously better. The S200 defaults to 25MP resolution but can go all the way down to 8MP, though weirdly any resolution below 25MP is 16:9 aspect with no option to change whilst 25MP is 4:3 which is the full sensor area.",2024-11-22 00:08:51,6,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1gwuhen/short_review_i_have_the_doogee_s200_rugged_which/,"camera, battery, performance",Xiaomi 14 Ultra,robbiekhan,1.0
