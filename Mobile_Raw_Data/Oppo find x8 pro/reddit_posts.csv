1hm2erb,How is the Oppo Find X8 Pro?,15,41,"Considering buying this phone or the OP13, but heavily favouring buying this because I had an oppo phone earlier and had literally no complaints with my R17 pro. Only battery got worse at the end of 3 years and got some amoled burn ins which is acceptable but I heavily regret going to Samsung after that. My r17 pro is still alive to this day almost 6 years later that's crazy.

I got my S22 plus after the r17 pro and I was disappointed to say the least within the year. Battery was horrible, phone randomly turned off and had to be hard resetted on two occasions, had a green line issue which I had to pay 50 dollars to fix through Samsung, and the screen still gave issues after that.

 Considering upgrading In January and the oppo find x8 pro caught my eye. Not as many reviews on it like the s24 ultra and i phone etc but for the number of reviews available they were all positive (however mostly sponsored). Originally was looking away because of the SOC but after i researched and got educated i realised mediatek isn't that bad and probably more efficient. 

Going back to oppo and color os is exciting but I will miss some One Ui features like Bixby routines (auto turn on Spotify music when I connect headphones etc), and the screen was indeed beautiful on the s22 plus and the ultrasonic fingerprint reader works like a charm but thats honestly where the positives end. 

I do plan to use this phone within north America for studies. So if there was any real advice  from people who bought this phone (bad and good) ill really appreciate it. Maybe we can have a discussion in the comments.

1i55mvz,Thoughts about the Oppo find X8 Pro vs the OnePlus 13? I'm thinking about getting one of the two ,9,48,"I might get a bit biased responses since it's the OPPO subreddit of course. Anyway I'm thinking about upgrading my S21 Ultra to either the OP 13 or Oppo find X8 Pro. I was thinking about the S24 Ultra at first but it seems these 2 phones are really good for the money. 

I'm not a gamer, at least not on phones. My main things I'm looking for is camera performance, UI and just a whole package. The Oppo seems to offer a better camera and the chipset and battery are performing identical to the OnePlus. It's got an extra button as well.

I've had the OnePlus One, 5T, 7 Pro and 9 Pro and decided to leave OnePlus after the 9 Pro. The 13 seems like a very solid buy

I can get the OPPO for €700 and OnePlus for around €850, so I'm leaning towards the OPPO. 

Do you have any experiences to either phone, and pros and cons to both? Really curious about the real world use

1ic5n0r,Oppo Find X8 Pro or Honor Magic 7 Pro?,6,34,"

Hi everyone,

I'm planning to buy either the Oppo Find X8 Pro or the Honor Magic 7 Pro, likely from Wonda Mobile. I live in the EU, the Honor here comes with a smaller battery. I’d love to hear from people who have used either of these devices to help me make the right choice since I plan to keep the phone for at least 2 years.

For context, I’ve already watched and read plenty of reviews about both smartphones, but I’m still on the fence. I should also mention that I previously owned the Honor Magic 6 Pro, and while it seemed promising, I didn’t like it that much. It didn’t feel like a flagship in many aspects, and I sold it after a few months.

Here are the specific things I’d like to know more about:

1. Cameras and Video: I feel like the Find X8 Pro has better cameras, more stable and true-to-life video performance, and more options in the camera app. Is this correct, or am I overestimating Oppo's advantage here?


2. Display and Eye Comfort: Is the Honor display really that much easier on the eyes compared to Oppo, or is it just a gimmick? I have sensitive eyes, and many smartphones, including iPhones, tend to bother me. They cause dryness, dizziness, and slight headaches. My current Vivo X100 Ultra is better in this regard, but I still have some issues occasionally.


3. Speakers: How do the speakers compare on both devices? I’ve read that the Magic 7 Pro has good speakers, but I’d love to hear real-world opinions.


4. Haptics: Haptics are very important to me. Which phone has stronger vibrations and better integration with the software for everyday use? I read that the Magic 7 Pro has improved haptics compared to the 6 Pro (which I found awful in that regard).


5. Heat Management and Battery: Battery life is a priority. Many tests show that the Find X8 Pro is more power-efficient, thanks to the Dimensity chip, and stays cooler under load. Reviewers also mention that the Magic 7 Pro with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 isn’t as efficient. What’s your experience?


6. Software: I’m familiar with MagicOS, as I’ve used Huawei phones before. While I managed to tweak the Magic 6 Pro to get notifications working better, I still had issues with some apps and occasional problems syncing with my Huawei Watch GT4. Is MagicOS 9 better in this regard? Does ColorOS on the Find X8 Pro handle notifications and background apps more reliably? Is ColorOS overall more stable and polished?


7. Build Quality and Durability: Honor advertises the Magic 7 Pro with its Nano Crystal Shield for added durability. Is it really that much more durable compared to the Find X8 Pro? I’ll use a tempered glass protector and case regardless, but this is still an important factor for me.


8. Biometrics: I like the Magic 7 Pro’s face ID and ultrasonic fingerprint scanner. How does Oppo compare here? Is the optical fingerprint scanner fast and reliable, and how’s the 2D face unlock performance?



To be honest, I’m leaning slightly toward the Oppo Find X8 Pro for reasons like the cameras, likely better battery life, and haptics. However, I’ve never used an Oppo phone before and don’t know what to expect from ColorOS. On the other hand, the things I like most about the Magic 7 Pro are the biometrics, speakers, and potentially the display, but I’m unsure if those three things are worth it in the long run.

Any honest opinions or experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.

1h2wng8,Xperia 1VI to Oppo Find X8 Pro,11,33,"O2 in the UK let me upgrade every three months, so I switched to the Oppo Find X8 Pro a couple of days ago, at least till the 1VII arrives, to see if the Chinese really are doing it better. Obvs, it's a mixed bag, but these are my first thoughts. Sorry they're so long. You win a bun if you get to the end.

**Oppo Cons:**

* **The audio is comparatively horsesh\*t.** Streaming LDAC maxxed in dev settings through UAPP is the same, pretty much, but the speakers are appalling - the strongest firing sideways and the weakest firing upward, so split stereo sounds horrendously unbalanced. And they're loud, but thin - shrill, compared to the Sony. Their Dolby equivalent - called 'oreality' or something - is just not as smooth or wide through a dongle compared to the Sony's jack output. And no matter how I tweak the volume, sometimes it's either too loud or too quiet, whereas the Sony was always just right. Guess I've been spoilt.
* **Build quality.** The Sony's ridged sides and dimpled back give it a grip the Oppo doesn't have, and the Xperia feels more solid and superbly engineered and balanced. Plus, with the style case it would sit flattish on a table, whereas the Oppo wobbles a bit more on it's camera bump and feels comparatively cheaper, though it still feels thin due its tapered sides. With that slimness, though, comes a fragile feel the Sony doesn't have, even though the Xperia's lighter. 
* **No SD card and a screen notch.** I've missed the SD card, even after two days. Having those 250 films on tap when you're in a dead zone is a boon, and they're there forever, a classic collection that's impervious to fickle streamer programming. Like having a DVD library in your pocket. And the notch is annoying on the Oppo, though flipping the phone upside down so it's on the right has put it a bit out of sight out of mind.
* **The full rez camera mode is pointless.** There's literally no point in having it. On the Sony, it's a total change of processing that gives really great, natural detail, compared to the jpegs. Yes, the HDR can be all over the place, but at least it does something. The Oppo macro also can't get anywhere near as close, though it at least has autofocus. 

**Oppo Pros:**

* **The screen is better.** it feels easier on the eye and, in Pro mode, looks quite accurate. And it seems to play nicer with streamers. Content on Prime and Netflix really shines in a way it never seemed to on the Xperia.
* **Color OS works well.** It's smooth and responsive with it's fluid animations, and the ability to change the theme (inc icon packs) on the fly via the theme store is refreshing, plus some of the AI photo editing stuff works - the reflection removal tool in particular. And it got an update on day one that improved the camera and added features. 
* **Performance is better.** Snappy as hell - particularly app switching - but then it has got more RAM (and twice the storage) and a next gen SooC. Gaming-wise, Asphalt also looks nicer and plays smoother, though it gets warmer. 
* **Battery is on par, if not better, but charging will smash it.** SOT seems great at the moment - around 8+hrs of heavy use - though it's very early days for the Oppo. I've bought a 50w wireless charger though, arriving tomorrow, and that should offer a juicing speed the Sony can't match wired.
* **Cameras.** I'll try to keep this short. The Oppo feels more consistent and natural, and details look more genuine if you zoom in, across all lenses (if a little too contrasty and 'flatter' at times). HDR is also better - less blown highlights all round, and less noise in all conditions. And, if you don't like the processing, in 'Master' mode you can tailor the jpegs yourself, adjusting sharpening, contrast, and saturation - and you can even add a variable vignette - as well as all the usual manual controls. But the main advantage is the zoom, beating Sony at anything over 2x, with the AI between 10x and 30x being surprisingly usable. Overall, better quality across a wider range, though I miss the quirky, DSLR feel of the Xperia's Bokeh mode and the occasional OMG factor of the 48mpx. 

And that's it. TL;DR - Sony's core features help it stand alone but the Oppo feels more like a next gen handset. 

I'm sorry, I'm out of buns, so this probably wasn't worth it. 

AMA if you're interested, but I hope the 1VII arrives rocking some fantastic sensors. I really do love Sony's swiss army knife approach and If they can make up some of the current shortfalls then I'd be tempted back in a heartbeat, because the Xperia still remains unique - oddball at times, but capable of genius.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyXperia/comments/1h2wng8/xperia_1vi_to_oppo_find_x8_pro/,1732916564.0,SonyXperia

Camera wise Vivo wins as per all i can see on youtube. I owned the X100 pro and really loved it for the camera. But as a phone it was pretty medicore. Functouch OS is so blant, haptics are pretty much not there or very weak, AOD notification limitation puts me off, Widgets padding it pretty bad, and no good functouch OS widgets for weather, calendar etc. (the inbuilt weather widget is horondous personally).

In comes Oppo with a very sleak looking Color OS. Pretty much as everything from a OS perspective i want. Great haptics that is system wide, good widgets, and lots of AI mambo jambo. The camera on the other hand is slightly inferior to Vivo.

Anybody who has used both shed some light. I am aware the vivo global model is still not out in many countries but i see some Malaysian users here. I am also aware i am posting this in Vivo which means a lot of vivo fans would say Oppo is trash.

1he0oaa,Vivo X200 Pro vs Oppo Find X8 Pro Camera Comparison: Which is Better? (Moon Shot),1,26,"
I came across a YouTube video comparing a moon shot taken with the Vivo X200 Pro and the Oppo Find X8 Pro (pic attached). The difference in quality is striking, though it’s possible the YouTuber didn’t use the optimal settings on the Oppo Find X8 Pro.

 May be someone with Oppo could try taking a good moon shot and post it. That would be great.  

I’m waiting for the Ultra versions of both phones to be released but unsure if they’ll launch globally. If I can’t decide between them, I might go for the OnePlus 13 to save some money and pair it with an external telephoto lens to make up for the extra zoom these phones offer.

For the ergonomics... Pixel 9 pro xl takes the win. The power-volume button and fingerprint placement is way smarter than find x8 pro. With the find x8 pro I need to get used to it a little compared to the pixel.

1h5s7ty,Oppo Find X8 Pro Global today or wait until Jan for the OnePlus 13 for same price (in Canada),9,18,"Hey guys. I have a friend in Hong Kong who can source me a Find X8 Pro Global for face value around 1300 CAD shipped to my door by early next week. I'm torn as I've been waiting for the OnePlus 13, but it looks like it won't begin shipping until at least after Jan 14th 2025, 6+ weeks away. 

On paper, both of these phones are very close, with subtle edges being traded between them. I'd imagine the NA version of the OP13 will end up around 800 USD (1100ish CAD) and with taxes in my province, it'll be almost identically priced to the Find X8 Pro I could get. I'm not really sure if there's enough the OP13 offers to wait the additional 2 months, for what will be the same price, but I'm curious what y'all think.

**Oneplus 13:**

**Pros:**

+ 90mah larger battery
+ better screen resolution
+ Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor
+ slightly faster charging but it doesn't matter in NA as we're limited to 80W
+ Snapdragon Elite vs MediaTek 9400 (this is debatable as a pro, as both are close and power consumption could be argued back and forth)

**Cons:**

- One less Telephoto lens
- Worse camera processing than the Oppo
- One less year of software and security updates
- No dedicated camera touch-button like the Find X8 Pro
- Slower updates than the ColorOS Oppo
- Uglier than the Find X8 Pro (imo)
- Lens Flair on camera seen in some YouTube comparisons

So pound for pound for the same price, should I be waiting around for the OnePlus or hop on the Oppo?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Oppo/comments/1h5s7ty/oppo_find_x8_pro_global_today_or_wait_until_jan/,1733245372.0,Oppo

The Oppo seems like an unbelievable phone however the MediaTek Dimensity chip has thrown me off as the SD Elite seems to be the better chip, not only in terms of the performance but also SD as a brand has been about for a lot longer and thus has been giving me doubts about the Oppo. 

The Hasselblad camera system also seems to be considerably better than the Magic.

As the title says, they basically share the same hardware except fot the 6x. Nonetheless, the Oppo Find x8 Pro is a proper cameraphone, with good RAW files and so on, while OP13 makes good pictures with Photo mode (still a bit over processed compare to Oppo) and pretty noisy RAWs.



What's your thoughts about this? Is it a clear choice from Oppo itself? Like selling their flagships as cameraphone and OP as the ""underdog"" (1000+ € underdog? Dunno...) ?



Or may even be the different processor? Maybe they optimized their camera algos for the Mediatek (which would make me think that the Ultra will use Mediatek).



Side note: I got the chance to have both of them in my hands and a part from camera quality I even noticed a bit of lag in OP13 compared to Oppo in loading the images in the gallery, so still somehow image related thinngs (both with latest fw).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Oppo/comments/1i3h80t/why_op13_has_not_the_same_camera_quality_of_oppo/,1737123200.0,Oppo

Vivo Pros:

Slightly better overall camera (though this is debatable in some instances)  
Better fingerprint sensor

Vivo camera is just awesome, I don't mind the software and the phone physically is easier to hold than the Oppo for me.
Oppo hardware is better things like the alert slider should be on every android phone it's really handy, the Ai on the Oppo is better and I've found zoom pictures over about 10 times zoom are better on the Oppo. There's an option to get Ai to summerise web pages for you and it's excellent, sadly missing from the Vivo at the moment. 
So conclusion is I'm keeping the Vivo because in most situations the camera is better, the Oppo is arguably better in most other aspects though. 
Not a lot between them if camera is your priority I would say get the Vivo for most other things the Oppo software is better. 
Both have awesome battery life, the camera module on the Vivo is bigger and does make it feel a bit top heavy, however I've found it easier to hold as my finger fits nicely under the module on the Vivo. 
Some of the zoom photos I've taken on the Vivo are a bit too over processed and false looking. But in most other situations the Vivo's camera is just awesome.

I plan on buying a new phone in China and I'm hesitating between the three. I'd be taking the 1TB version. 

Here's are some informations I've found so far that seems important to me from my pov but correct me if I'm wrong :

Vivo 200x pro :


Pros:
- one of the best lately for taking pictures and videos and level of details with zoom. 
- good performance with diversity 9400?

Cons :
- Os seems to be not so intuitive and good? I mean I'll be using OriginOS but idk much about those stuff. 
- AI might be inferior to oppo and honor last flagships? 
- only 4 years updates

Overall I guess it has the best picture/video quality out of the three but also compared to also flagships competitors. 

Honor Magic 7pro :


Pros :
- very good performance with snapdragon elite
- very quick and fast in general when using phone also the facial ID and fingerprint super fast
- 5 years updates? 
- heard that the MagicOs is good and intuitive? 
- better AI than the other two? 
- better screen than the other two? 

Cons :
- pictures and videos aren't so good compared to the other two
- no partnership like zeiss or hasselbad? 

Overall I guess the honor magic 7 pro focus on high performance instead and Ai rather. 


Oppo find X8 pro :


Pros :
- good performance with the diversity 9400
- good Os and highly customizable seems like it? 
- photos are good too with hasselbad.
- 5 years updates

Cons :
- photo colors cold? 
- maybe lackluster in terms of pictures compared to vivo 200x pro? 

Overall the Oppo is a balance between performance and pictures, it's like a mix of the honor 200x pro for pics and the honor magic 7 pro for the performance. 

What do you guys think is the best phone to get? Overall? I do play a lot but I also love/do take a lot of pictures/videos as well.
