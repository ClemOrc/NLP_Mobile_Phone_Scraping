I've had a Pixel 9 Pro XL, S24 Ultra and iPhone 15 Pro Max this year and I can comfortably say the Oppo Find X8 Pro is as good if not better than all 3 handsets. You won't regret getting one.",23,CoolbananasKD,1735140451.0

1hm2erb,m3qzbhb,"I have mine since last Saturday. My previous phone was an iphone 13 pro. 

I bought my X8 pro for 899€, which was the maximum I wanted to spend on a phone. But I do have to say I really like it so far! 

Battery is great, UI is very smooth and responsive. Camera's feel like a huge step up compared to my iphone 13 pro. Comes with some features I will try out next week when im having a small holiday. 

I do need more time to fully adjust to android again and set things up exactly how I want and like it. 
I feel the phone is very slippery tho, so a case is on the way. Im too afraid to drop it right now. 

All in all, I give it a solid 8/10. It feels like a huge upgrade from the 13 pro and I have no regrets switching.",3,NINJATONYSOPRANO,1735143419.0

1hm2erb,m3t8owh,"I recently upgraded from the Pixel 7 Pro to the Oppo Find X8 Pro, and I can confidently recommend the Find X8 series.

What sets this phone apart isn’t just its impressive hardware—it’s the software. ColorOS 15 is packed with practical, daily-use features that truly enhance the overall experience. It’s a fantastic upgrade for anyone looking for a feature-rich and reliable device.",1,GS-Rolex,1735175123.0
1hm2erb,m3u8160,"Used the Find X8 Pro for about a month as I won it from a contest. Previously used an S22 Ultra, and currently on the iPhone 16pm. 

The whole UI is smooth and sleek, somewhat similar to iOS if you are coming from Apple. Cameras are also great, much better than the S22 Ultra that I was using previously, but for shooting people it seems that the processing of the iPhone does it better. 

Only gripes I had were the weight and finish of the phone. The finish made the phone extremely slippery, and the light weight of it made it feel a little bit cheap for a premium phone. But that’s just me, it could be a good thing for you.",1,shootingrays89,1735192045.0

However for having OOS 15 and COS 15, I still can understand how people can say the OS is smooth.
Tons of bloatwares, full of micro lags, not to mention intrusive at a point if you don't opt in, the OS has absolutely no functionalities they advertise for.
At least Samsung let you use AI locally and secure your data.

1hm2erb,m8w39jl,"You can use Master Mode in auto settings and it's far less HDR focused. I'm not sure if it's the same for the OnePlus 13 but they both use essentially the same software so I'd imagine they must have an equivalent? 

I came from a Pixel 9 Pro XL and have to say the OS is very well refined and slick. The main difference is little quirks like the ""dynamic island"" copy that Oppo uses and the notification/control centre is more iOS but beyond that you can make it as stock or as Chinese as you like. I'd say PixelOS, ColorOS and then OneUI in that order for me anyway.",1,CoolbananasKD,1737716276.0
1hm2erb,m8w3gvn,"Yeah that's probably a fair criticism, if you use Master Mode in auto it's much less AI led and the photos have a much more natural/neutral feel to them.

1hm2erb,m3rd8da,"Sure, yeah s22 was horrible Samsung support on the screen for me was terrible as well, they are saying the mediatek processors have 90% the power of snapdragon but way more power efficient which means less heat and less throttling, more stability and more battery. Would have seriously considered OP13 as well but OP exists as like a digital store where i live and most of their servicing is done through the same place as oppo here anyway.

Vivo software though compared to the rest is still subpar ig that's the only negative that I've seen from the x200, otherwise best camera in the game, top 2 processer, can't go wrong with the phone, only issue if you were to nitpick would be funtouch os",1,Upstairs_Kitchen_980,1735149229.0

1hy3b14,m6e803k,"It doesn't make sense to me either. The oppo definitely has the slightly better camera but it is very close. 

The microphone on the OnePlus is far better from the sound tests I've heard, which makes it better for calls and also picking up audio in recordings. OnePlus also has a slightly bigger battery and slightly faster charging but you'll barely notice the difference. The fingerprint sensor is ultrasonic on the OnePlus whereas it's optical on the oppo so it's a bit quicker. Screen on the OnePlus also works better with gloves. 

I do think the oppo find x8 pro is a slightly more attractive phone though.",7,Internetolocutor,1736513612.0
1hy3b14,m6eslro,"Honestly, these two phones are so close to each other their differences are probably negligible. One is a little better than the other at some things but in the end the hardware is practically even.

The real reason why there's price differences is because of the region variants being different. 

If you're in the US, the global model 13 is easier and cheaper to get than the global model X8 Pro because the X8 Pro doesn't sell here. You have to import it. And the global models are always more expensive to import, usually adds about $400-$500 to the total cost.

However, the Chinese model 13 and X8 Pro are cheaper than their global model counterparts, so in some cases if you import the Chinese model of either brand, you could possibly get either one cheaper than what you'd get the global 13 for.

Problem is, the Chinese model isn't fully compatible with US carriers (if you're in the US that is) so you'll run into some compatibility issues like trying to use Verizon/AT&T and then some intermittent problems with Google services too. A lot of people don't really care about that though, especially if you have strong T-Mobile service and you don't use many of the picky Google services that don't play nice with different region devices.


I bought the 13 because, besides phone preference, it's easier to get and fix if issues arise because OnePlus is local, and I don't have to worry about possible region compatibility issues (even though I use T-Mobile, I use rural bands that China models don't support). I bought mine from a Best Buy store just a few hours away.",4,TheOriginalElTigre,1736521150.0

U will get 5 years of android updates and 6years of security updates.
Color OS is almost a complete OS, better than One UI
It's parallel processing is just top notch.
Oppo is giving you 6x optical zoom which is amazing.
(Check camera results on youtube, it leaves iphone 16pro and s24 pro way behind, iPhone's video is better as it gives u 4k with 120fps, but oppo gives u 4k 60fps, HDR, DOLBY VISION recording which I guess is enough)
Oppo has optimised mediatek 9400 much much better than any other device, no heating complaints like One Plus 13.
U will get 16/512 varient.
AI and OS fratures are amazing.
Display is again top notch 
1.5k LTPO amoled, HDR10+, 1 BILLION colors, DOLBY VISION.
It's much much better option.",1,TheXclone,1732777923.0

Oxygen OS is actually the Color OS with changed name
All features are ditto same 
The only major differences between these 2 are

1. Op13 has 2k display oppo has 1.5k  
     (However 2k displays consume more battery and u can google anywhere their differences are unnoticeable)
Rest all display quality are same

2. OP 13 has a slightly better processor SD 8 elite.
     But with the review I have seen from reviewers around the world, well OnePlus 13 hasn't been able to tame the beast so resulting in overheating.
Mediatek 9400 is not very far from it too.

3. Ultrasonic fingerprint which One plus 13 has oppo find X8 pro has optical fingerprint scanner (I don't think much difference it will make)

4. Oppo find x8 pro has dedicated camera touch button u can click, zoom using this (which I also think that it doesn't make any difference)

5. Both have alert silder which I love


PS - see I have been waiting for OP13 since September 
After seeing Oppo's features I was like it's ok I will sacrifice the camera and go with 2k Display but with the reviews I watched and research I did I found that display difference is something which is unnoticeable and mediatek is nicely optimised by Oppo ...
Which gives better performance and no overheat

I have the Oppo Find X8 Pro and have the OnePlus 13 in the mail (had OnePlus 12 too). They are very similar but not the same. Here are some differences I know of (both global versions not Chinese models):

* OnePlus drops the second telephoto camera (6x) on 13 for three cameras total vs four on Oppo.
* OnePlus drops the quick button (camera button) on 13. Has more bands (71 for T-Mobile, 30 for AT&T, 48 for Verizon, great for US users) on 13. Not sure if you are in the US.
* Changed from MediaTek Dimensity 9400 on Oppo to SnapDragon 8 Elite on OnePlus
* Potentially a few less ""bloatware"" preinstalled apps on 13.
* The price difference - $899 vs $1100+.
* Most likely better app support for the “dynamic island” feature on 13 (Oppo “Live Alerts” - capsule). The Oppo has a short list of supported apps in settings for this.
* OnePlus has 6.82” 3168x1440 (510 ppi) vs 6.78” 2780x1264 (450 ppi) on Oppo.
* OnePlus has ultrasonic FPR higher up (like Vivo), Oppo uses optical and lower down.
* OnePlus offers 6000 mAh on 13, Oppo packs in 5910 mAh.
* Both 80 watt wired and 50 watt wireless charging, Beacon Link, Alert Slider, IP68/IP69 ratings. Both state 6yr security updates.
* OnePlus weights 210-213g and 8.5 or 8.9mm (depending on color you pick) thick vs 215g and 8.2mm on Oppo.

Very good processor fast efficient , I have no gripes with it, but it there to cut cost while at the same time oppo is charging premium price. The oppo x6 pro( which I own and love) it used the snapdragon gen 2 all the phone x6 line up used it , the x7 used snapdragon gen 3 all used it yet the x8 and x8 pro are using deminsity 9400 while the x8 ultra is gonna use the new snapdragon elite. Look at the Xiaomi 15 or the OnePlus 13 also using elite. So the onepkus 13 using it and cheaper but the oppos pro can't 

Now the camera , oppo spent years pushing about the camera size now in this oppo x8 pro every camera sensor is smaller then not only it predecessor but it contemporaries like the vivo x200 pro.when I say smaller I don't mean alttle the main sensor is 40% smaller then the x6 pro and x7 ultra .the 3x zoom is actually using an ultrawide senor the lyt 600instead of the better IMX sensor on like x6 pro. So u can't argue having a smaller sensor doesn't have an effect on photos especially low light photos. Oppo using newer software like ai zoom and other to compensate and it shows. Yes they still look good but u can see the extra processing.alot more fake sharpening like in tree and grass,.etc   I would say even the vivo x100 pro better.

1h86sn9,m0rgx8j,"Well so far I'm loving this beast.
Hardware is amazing..
Love the haptics, sound, butter smooth OS, solid battery (infact I am very surprised with the battery optimisation)
However I haven't tested the camera yet, bcz didn't get the chance will do in upcoming days.
My frnd bought apple 16 pro 2 days ago and we both had kinda compitition regarding smoothness of OS, so we keep opening and closing the apps and at one point apple started shuttering, Oppo was the same smooth which impressed me.
Rest pros are totally subjective 
 1. Design feels so premium dark gray glass matt back with black camera bump feels classy.
(However I love the camera bump of IQoo 13 among all launched flagships, I will put Oppo 2nd)
2. Display and multimedia experience is amazing
3. Gaming was awesome too, the device didn't heat.
 (This point is not subjective tho)
4. I am coming from an ancient OS which is funtouch OS, using it since funtouch 11 to 14 still they haven't changed even in 15th version. So Color OS feels amazing 

Cons (which are subjective as well)
1. Instead of power+volume up button to restart/off the phone they should have given power option with setting tab in control center like in Funtouch OS 14

2. They should have positioned the finger print scanner just a bit above and volume rocker and power button just a bit below 

3. When changing icon color to device wallpaper color some app's icon color remains the same (which was also in Funtouch OS)

4. They should add more apps to the dynamic island..guess they will do that in future.

Conclusion so far as I have expected this device is complete all rounder.
Rest will tell you after using it for 10 days.

Check this post for a lot of useful information

I’ve been using my Oppo Find X8 Pro, and it’s truly amazing—I wouldn’t switch to the OP13. To be honest, flagship phones these days are all incredibly advanced, and in terms of everyday use, you probably won’t notice significant differences. The most noticeable distinction, however, is in camera quality, and in this area, the Oppo Find X8 Pro outperforms the OP13.",7,Consistent-Bath5257,1737312991.0
1i55mvz,m80zxv1,If it's the camera and not gaming then find x8 pro is a clear winner.  I own it for 1.5mont and it's a complete flagship experience. And if it's cheaper then it's a no-brainer really.,8,lukeroux1,1737313084.0
1i55mvz,m823frt,"I had the same doubt and went for the Oppo. I got the chance to use the OP13 as well for some time and decided to go for the Oppo for a few reasons.



First of all, I also value the camera, a lot, and initially I was doubtful since Oppo and OnePluse share the exact same sensors (a part from the 6x ofc). Now, what became evident to me are two things: Oppo has better glasses and Oppo has better processing.


This is true for both Jpegs in auto mode and RAWs in master mode. The photo from auto mode are abut over processed for both of them imho, but a bit less on the Oppo. Regarding the RAWs, Oppo has a bit more details and sharpness while you can tell that OP13 has way more noise, both have noise when ISO goes over 600, but OP13 already at 400 in the shadows. In Lightroom the files are easy to work for both tho, even the JPEGs have good range in shadows and highlights.



The camera button on the Oppo is a total downside of it and something that initially was taking me to the OP13. Basically it is hard to find most of the time, the double click takes you ONLY to the photo mode and not to the latest that you used and with gloves or in difficult condition it's easy to slide by mistake. The good thing is that it never happened that the camera started by itself. The WORST part is that they disabled the option that is in all Androids to click twice the power button in order to launch the camera...which is literally one of my favourite features of Android when compared to iPhone, since I shoot a lot of pictures. Here I don't have it and I really hope they enable it again.



Moving from the cameras. OP13 has slightly better vibration, but Oppo has a great one as well, it's just that the OP one is just perfect. I have no other definition for it.


Oppo is nicer to hold in the hand (I don't use covers), to me at least. OnePlus has a slightly crispier screen. Oppo has better facial recognition. OnePlus has faster fingerprint sensor but I really don't understand ppl complaining for the optical one because it's a fraction of a fraction of a second slower...I mean the real difference is that with the OP's ultrasonic as soon as a small part of my thumb touches it, it goes, while with Oppo I have to put almost the whole thumb to be recognized.
Oppo has better construction in my opinion, the volume and power button are more clicky. 




Mediatek vs Snap 8 Elite. Oppo never overheated, OP13 did it once, not much, but happened. OnePlus is slightly faster when exporting from Lightroom, especially LR goes in the background, nothing mind blowing tho. Same battery life with mixed use (YouTube, Lightroom, Camera, Reddit, Whatsapp), maybe OP13 a bit better but we are talking minutes.




ColorOS vs OxygenOS. Basically the same thing, very small differences and nothing really functional (a part from the double click on power to launch the camera...dammit), however ColorOS got more updates recently. My feeling is that it is the ""main"" one and OxygenOS is treated as the secondary one, this is the overall feeling between Oppo and OnePlus branding tho.



That's it, I hope it will help you decide. Anyhow, we are talking about small details here...I mean the only real difference is the camera processing but I also got conditions where OP13  pics were nicer and the raws were less noisy than Oppo. It is more about the consistency, Oppo gives you the ""expected"" result 95% of the time. With ""expected"" I mean that what you see before shooting is very similar to what you get in the Gallery and once you learn the limits (in terms of ISO, light, etc) of the device, you get consistently good photos. OnePlus is consistently in auto modo but way less in Master mode.",7,Naive_Banana4447,1737324397.0

I've had the OnePlus 5t and 9 pro before.
I was in a dilemma when buying next phone.

Vivo x200 pro , OnePlus 13 and Find x8 pro was in my final list.

Avoided Vivo due to its crappy OS and decided to go with oppo find x8 pro since it has colour OS, alert slider and better camera setup.

If your focus is only on camera and not worried about alert slider and Android experience, go for Vivo. Otherwise, Find x8 pro is a solid buy.

I'm happy with X8 pro, the battery backup of this phone is also awesome.

1i55mvz,m853nzo,"I've had the OnePlus 11 OnePlus Open and OnePlus 12 and this time opted for the Oppo Find X8 Pro and I couldn't be happier.

There's a couple of reasons I went for the Oppo Find X8 Pro, firstly the SoC - Dimensity 9400 although technically not as powerful as the SD 8 Gen Elite it's more power efficient and doesn't throttle as much.

Secondly the customer service that Oppo provides is much better than OnePlus.

When I had the OnePlus Open I had to contact Customer Services and they were next to useless.

On OP13 they have the double press on the power button, on the Oppo it is not and I believe that is to push you to use the camera button.

1ic5n0r,m9ojbdf,"I don't have time to comment on all your points but I can tell you few words about cameras. Overall I believe both honor and oppo perform really well when it comes to cameras and they are fairly close. 

Oppo does have 2 zoom cameras but generally honor makes it up with much better sensor, Honor also has better focus distance on the periscope. 
For the main cameras both perform really well and aren't far away from eachother, though I do believe Honor does better at night because of the really wide f/1.4 aperture. Ultrawides do give similar results.

Oppo for sure has a really nature rendering of colours and fairly natural rendering of details, Honor did improve a bit recently but it does tend to rewrite some details and sharpen stuff in the background. When it comes to colours Honor often is more saturated but I also find natural and authentic colour nodes fairly close to real life in most scenarios, especially at night. And authentic/haircourt colours are phenomenal for portraits. 

When it comes to video, Honor is still pretty mediocre with it, the quality isn't bad but it isn't ideal either. I know find X7 ultra had phenomenal video quality but from what I know find X8 pro video quality is worse and I think overall comparable to Honor, maybe slightly better.

When it comes to selfie, historically it has been a weak point of oppo and I don't think that much changed with fx8p, while honor in my experience has pretty good selfie camera.

But I would always recommend OPPO over Honor in most cases, their OS is leagues better in terms of smoothness, features and aesthetics. The image processing for the camera is also way better for my tastes. The hardware itself + haptics feel way nicer in hand.

In fact some haptics like moving from letter to letter with Gboard do not work at all which will likely disappoint you immensely. The Oppo battery should offer a longer lifespan thanks to their patented tech on top of a cooler SOC. The Oppo optical fingerprint sensor is fine, it just isn't secure.

1ic5n0r,m9q8fy3,"I have the EU version, battery life is subjective but I would say for me a day and a morning with high use so youtube , music, news apps, voice calls etc. Normal use I would say easily 2 days. 

So far I've had 2 updates first one was Magicos 9 and then a week later I had another update adding camera zoom AI feature among a few other things.

 3D face unlock works without fail and it's compatible with most apps apart from my banking app with Halifax. 

The convenience of just looking at your phone to securely unlock it is the highlight for me, especially if you're out and about. 

Camera is good enough and up there with the best, and I think most folks will be happy with it. AI zoom photos works very well for buildings but not so much with people. 

The phone also  has a dedicated communication chip called the C2 which enhances your phone  and WiFi signal. I must say  I did  notice a small improvement reception wise compared to my Xiaomi 13 pro which it's replacing.

The haptics too are subtle but very responsive so all good there too in my opinion. 

I did test out notifications such Gmail and WhatsApp and they came through a second  quicker than on my old Xiaomi 13 pro which was also connected to WiFi so no issue at all.

 If you get a Chinese version then maybe there will be issues as they block everything to save battery but the EU one is fine and there is no need to change any battery settings in this respect. 

Oppo are great for updates better than Samsung in my opinion. I use to have an Oppo Find x2 pro and it was still receiving monthly updates after 3 years.

1guqega,lzfou45,"Indeed you are biased.
Apple is good professionally
Android is good playfully

Apple is super reliable, everything done smooth,good.
Android is experimentation, like 20 camera modes, 100 different options, tweaks, custom launchers etc.,


And now realme can airdrop to apple, and apple accepts RCS, reduce the exclusivity except facetime. Unless all my circle have apple, I cant leave 1 Android family/ friend and do facetime with rest. So that's a bummer and people will not use web facetime (alternative for Android users by apple) as they have many alt like whatsapp, signal.

That said Android cannot have smoother animations like apple.

And also apple cannot have custom launchers, not custom icons, not custom modded apps, adfree youtube for free and lot more features much more than the word limit on reddit.

Tech nerds should consider Android, professionals and others who want everything automatically done right should consider iphone.

Note - yes I'm aware you have youtube ++ for apple but that gets signing issue very often and custom icons is not 1 click away like Android.

Even processors, iCloud free storage, ai power is superior in Android.

Atleast samsung promised and gave the ai which apple is still testing, and samsung is free till 2025 but not apple.

And funny part - apple is supposed to talk about softwares and ai in WWDC and about hardware and phones in Apple launch event
But they spend 50% of time in Apple event to talk about AI because they had nothing else to speak.

That said I personally have used both and both have its own goods and bad and blindly saying apple is best doesn't makes sense.

From real life speed tests, to bench mark like antutu to dxomarks - Android just screws apple

And price, especially India. 

Note - apple manufacturing multiple models in India and still charges extra import tax as if they are imported.

1hwnsix,m67gvm9,"Eh, not really. You still have 10x on the S24 Ultra, and it's pretty comparable to the 10x sensor in performance on the S22 and S23 Ultra, if not sometimes better with the updates the device received over the past year.

My wife has regularly said that the 10x shots on my S24 Ultra come out better than the 10x shots on her S22 Ultra, and at times I agree, though this wasn't always the case.

For example: [this elephant shot was taken with my S24 Ultra at 10x zoom](https://i.imgur.com/7YnPEpM.jpeg), and this from the same distance [using the 10x on my wife's S22 Ultra](https://i.imgur.com/8bgL9sp.jpeg). The S24 Ultra handled the dynamic range better even if it's a bit less detailed than the S22 Ultra shot.

I'm OK with this tradeoff as it allows me to capture really good 5x shots and portraits. It's great to have an intermediate zoom length that captures really great shots instead of the massive jump between 3x and 10x. I actually found myself missing the 4x sensor on my Pixel 6 Pro more often than I expected when I had upgraded to the S22 Ultra initially.",8,MaverickJester25,1736420734.0

but trying to be objective, I think the only reason for getting a Pixel 9 Pro (XL?) is it's from Google and it gets the latest updates before Oppo, and possibly more of them, especially going forward. And if you value Gemini and AI, it's probably better integrated.

Regarding software support, currently they are on par... Pixel has 7 years of support and Oppo Find X8 Pro has 6 years (5 years of major updates).  But since Pixel is out since a while, they kind of have 6 years left.

I think software is the only advantage Pixel 9 Pro has, really. It depends how much you value it.

wanted to buy pixel 9 pro or oppo

I decided for oppo

I want to keep the phone for 4-5 years to make use of the software support of 5 years

why oppo, because of the CPU, gpu, camera

new android versions will run on pixel but tensor g4 is garbage low cpu, compared to dimensity 9400

the cpu/gpu is like 3 times better than pixel 9, just image this phone performance on android 19 for example, how will pixel run, no idea, but I want future proofing

internal storage speed, oppo has ufs 4.0+ some extra stuff, pixel 9 has ufs 3.1

CPU is also using 3nm, tensor is based on exynos 4nm, and modem is also exynos meeh

I don;t take a lot of photos, but I like the extra zoom on oppo

the camera is up to you

oppo for battery, si/C fast charching 80W

SCreen is also bigger on oppo, but I would preffer pixel 9 pro size phone

ColorOS for oppo, 0 bloatware, you can uninstall all apps, or you can disable if not needed

TLDR

pixel 9 IF you like the camera or you need unlocked bootloader, you can install grapheneos if needed for example

oppo, camera, CPU, GPU, STORAGE, ufs 4.0, wifi 7, better 5g modem than exynos, battery

the hardware in oppo is high end, premium hardware

pixel only has screen that is good and camera, rest is low end hardware

1h2wng8,lzmiqf1,">**The audio is comparatively horsesh\*t.**

This is unfortunately something that is very common on many new phones these days. This isn't exclusive to oppo, but also affects brands like xiaomi, samsung etc. It's a trend I do not particularly enjoy but seems the mainstream simply don't care all that much about the speakers anymore.

>**The full rez camera mode is pointless.** There's literally no point in having it. On the Sony, it's a total change of processing that gives really great, natural detail, compared to the jpegs. Yes, the HDR can be all over the place, but at least it does something. The Oppo macro also can't get anywhere near as close, though it at least has autofocus.

Have to disagree, there is nothing natural about that abysmal 48mp mode of the Xperia. It's inconsistent as all hell and introduces some strong blooming, I found it to be extremely gimmicky compared to the full res mode on other phones, which already are gimmicky to begin with, can the 48mp mode produce good pictures? sure, but rolling the dice and hope the processing plays along is not a strong point.

>**The screen is better.** it feels easier on the eye and, in Pro mode, looks quite accurate. And it seems to play nicer with streamers. Content on Prime and Netflix really shines in a way it never seemed to on the Xperia.

This is mostly due to the fact that Chinese phones are heavily optimized for content and HDR, even cheaper phones such as the Oneplus have some extremely impressive display tech and software to deliver the best streaming experience. I mean if you stream anything with dolby vision support, good lord does it look nice, once you experienced high tier displays, you can really see how far behind the Xperia line is, even with their 4k displays.

>**Performance is better.** Snappy as hell - particularly app switching - but then it has got more RAM (and twice the storage) and a next gen SooC. Gaming-wise, Asphalt also looks nicer and plays smoother, though it gets warmer.

Has to do with the fact that the RAM management is very relaxed and not aggressive at all compared to Sony. Also games have a profile based on SoC and display, Asphalt runs on a higher internal resolution on the oppo.

>**Battery is on par, if not better, but charging will smash it.** SOT seems great at the moment - around 8+hrs of heavy use - though it's very early days for the Oppo. I've bought a 50w wireless charger though, arriving tomorrow, and that should offer a juicing speed the Sony can't match wired.

imo Battery is far superior on the oppo, the silicon carbon batteries on these Chinese phones have way more density and are way better designed, they last longer and are much more resilient, you can charge at 80W and your battery won't care or degrade, same as the whooping 50W wireless charging, I mean charging 40% in 15minutes is just so much better than Sonys turtlecharge tech.

>**Cameras.** I'll try to keep this short. The Oppo feels more consistent and natural, and details look more genuine if you zoom in, across all lenses (if a little too contrasty and 'flatter' at times). HDR is also better - less blown highlights all round, and less noise in all conditions. And, if you don't like the processing, in 'Master' mode you can tailor the jpegs yourself, adjusting sharpening, contrast, and saturation - and you can even add a variable vignette - as well as all the usual manual controls. But the main advantage is the zoom, beating Sony at anything over 2x, with the AI between 10x and 30x being surprisingly usable. Overall, better quality across a wider range, though I miss the quirky, DSLR feel of the Xperia's Bokeh mode and the occasional OMG factor of the 48mpx.

You do have option between leica authentic and vivid. Also I would argue the 'quirky DSLR feel' has been burried with the Xperia 1 V, the 1 VI feels like glorified pixel UI. Also Bokeh on Xperia is nothing compared to the real bokeh of the Oppo main sensor. As you mentioned, Oppos approach is much like DSLR cameras, rather natural and not much enhancements going on.

Little funfact for you, you can download a remote app and use the phone to control your TV's, Recorders etc. with the IR blaster on the phone. You can also do funky pranks in restaurants who have TV's up and running.

Are you going to do side by sides or did you already return the 1 VI?

  
EDIT:

>**Color OS works well.** It's smooth and responsive with it's fluid animations, and the ability to change the theme (inc icon packs) on the fly via the theme store is refreshing, plus some of the AI photo editing stuff works - the reflection removal tool in particular. And it got an update on day one that improved the camera and added features.

  
Just wait until you messed up a picture with to low SS and then AI anti blur saves the day. These AI tools for editing are far from gimmicky, unblur in particular is amazing, even old pictures can be saved with it.",-5,Blunt552,1732918931.0

1h2wng8,lzosdiu,"Aside from the AI, the Oppo has some old holdovers that I thought I'd never see again. The first is the alert slider. A robust switch on the left for ring/vibrate/silence that is very handy to quickly mute everything. I remember having that years ago (on an LG? Or was it the iPhone 4?) and am glad it's back. 

The other is an IR blaster, which I've never used but they were once all-the-rage. Having these practical physical features Apple can't be arsed with feels very Sony.

The rest feels like optimisation, which is the most frustrating thing. Sensor size aside, Sony could do all this if it invested in their software. Taking a hands-off approach  expecting folk to fall back to full-manual can only go so far,  and sometimes they're only tiny things.

Quick e.g. Oppo's portrait mode has a dot on the UI telling you what the default bokeh level is. Very simple, but when I dialled it down on the 1VI it was annoying being unable to reset it without having to reset the entire app.

By my logic you buy what you want and enjoy but be honest about the thing you have to other people. When people ask for an excellent camera phone and people here pretend the xperia is some next gen pro device while the exact opposite is true how the fk is that ok? When audiophiles ask if sony is finally the lg replacement and the sony glazers start gaslighting and lying to the people, how the fk is that ok?

I get what you say about people identifying with their purchase, though, but then isn't that what people do? Isn't  that why there are tech tribes - people focussing on the positives, on what they want, and sidelining the negatives. The big three have plenty of both too. Visitors to subs have to sort the wheat from the chaff. It's all part of any pre-purchase research, and anyone who relies solely on a sub gets what they deserve.

Now that doesn't mean the Oppo Find X8 Pro is trash by any means but the results from various tests online speak for themselves. As a previous FunTouchOS user (now OriginOS), the former isn't spectacular features wise, but it's still alright and it does a good enough job. But I believe the global variant comes with new AI features & even integrates Google's Circle To Search, so that's quite a nice upgrade to the OS. Perhaps ColorOS is a little more mature and is more confident with what it is and to be fair, Oppo's really good overall so you can't go wrong with either.

The Pixel has some Google only software for the camera that's pretty great, I'm not entirely sure which has the better canera otherwise. The Pixel has a slightly higher res screen but otherwise pretty similar between the two. The battery life of the Oppo is almost unbelievable with the new battery type. Oppo has a faster processor but less RAM. 512GB is the only storage option available in Au, so remember that when comparing. The Oppo charges faster.

For me personally I love the alert slider of the Oppo and the OnePlus phones. I work in a noisy workplace and have to take calls in the field and attend multiple meetings a day. Being able to slide the phone back to silent or vibrate in my pocket without looking at it as I return to the office or enter a meeting is such an advantage for me. It also comes with an extra button that opens the camera without having to unlock the phone that will be handy for some. Not sure if it can be reprogrammed. As for OS differences I run Microsoft Launcher so I am generally pretty ignorant of OS differences. 

The Oppo comes with a free tablet via redemption atm, no idea how good it is though.

I can't find any price related to the oppo find x8 below 1,799 (and I'm in Melbourne too!). It's crazy funny if you go to the oppo online store from a different country you'll see there's 2 options the default cheaper x8 and then the Pro, but for Aus it's just the Pro.

1hvsynn,m5zvdey,"I have been using three of the cameras you mentioned. The X200 Pro camera is the best in my opinion. With the X8 Pro, I was pleased with the daytime images, but the bokeh effect was inconsistent. This was noticeable in the photos I took of my baby, which I have shared with Oppo support to address. Additionally, the Wi-Fi on the X8 Pro is slower compared to the X200 Pro, an issue I have confirmed through multiple tests.

The nighttime images on the X8 Pro are problematic, appearing noisy and exhibiting a pink tint. I have also reported this issue to Oppo support.  In contrast, the S24 Ultra cameras did not meet my expectations, prompting me to sell mine and purchase the X8 Pro through an exchange and additional payment.

I stupidly bought five cases for the X8P - first a dirt-cheap clear plastic job, two 'leather'-backs (one with a kickstand), the Nillkin and the official Oppo.

The Nillkin looked the best, was the grippiest, and the lens cover/stand was great but it was the heaviest and I felt it didn't protect the edges of the screen enough. It was also the only one that didn't play nice with wireless charging. Both the leather-backs felt cheap and the green one was a bit loose at the corners. The official Oppo was obviously strong but didn't protect the sides at all and didn't cover the corners as well as the Nillkin, or provide any cover for the camera island.

So, for me, the best was the first and one of the cheapest, the Carinacoco clear case from Amazon. Bumpers covered the corners well, there was some lens protection, and a lip was raised all round the screen to protect that curved edge.",2,roomyverse,1737664276.0

many people have feedback about samsung's poor and inconsistent camera performance. samsung said there will be an update to the cameras. there has been 0 updates for the camera since the phone launched in january. safe to say this will be my last samsung.

Rest as you mentioned display, let me tell you the only difference is OP13 has 2k and Oppo has 1.5k Visually u won't be able to notice the difference much.

* mediatek 9400 is better optimised by Oppo, no overheating, while on other hand have seen videos of OP13 getting heated upto 45-47 during stress test and all.
* Camera of Oppo is mesmerizing, and gonna get much better after upcoming update for cameras. Also 6x optical zoom is insane man.

> A lot of hardware features that emulators use are not available on Mali GPUs or are really slow . Having to do particular tasks using Software meaning at those particular tasks, Mali GPU phones will always be slow. And there's the issue of broken GPU drivers. Even when ARM fixes issues, your phone manufacturer might never update your phone with the latest driver. AdrenoTools, used to load custom Adreno drivers, do not work on Mali GPUs (I think gpucode tried on Citra, they are actively blocked). MESA, the open source project for drivers has never and is not working on open source Mali GPU drivers. The only open source Mali GPU driver, panvk is barebones, can't run anything as complicated as switch emulation and most importantly, there's no way to use it on android phones.

Although the battery specs for the UK honor is less than the oppo, the snap dragon 8 elite, the phone claims it can do 24hrs easily and I believe it can. 

I like the display on the honor more, it's slightly wider and has better eye care software built in and hardware. It also has 3d face unlock like an iPhone and ultrasonic fingerprint like the Samsung. 

But in terms of features I would say the oppo has more, the oppo has a camera control button, alert slider, then it has a lot more ai features than the honor.  The oppo is also one of the only phones at the moment that can do air drop with iOS. 


In terms of build both are good, the honor does feel more premium because it's heavier and boxier, but Im actually preferring  the thinness and lightness of the oppo. 

The best way to put this I would say is the build of the honor is like the s23 ultra, and the build of the oppo is more like the S20 plus in my opinion. 


Onto the cameras, the oppo has a quad 50mp setup, the honor has triple cameras 2x  50mp and 1x 200mp telephoto at 3x zoom. 

Now this 200mp camera in my opinion is a gimmick compared to oppo. People are saying it should get better with updates but I'm not sure, the oppos camera are lot more consistent and just look better. Who knows it might get better with updates but then the same can also be said out the oppo..

So whilst I myself is torn between which one to keep and which one to return, I keep leaning more towards the oppo. I love the display on the honor and the 3d face unlock is a good thing to have but the cameras are just not that good.",2,Lordv259,1737244335.0

They have great cameras, which are basically on par with each other, people are saying that the honor is slightly better with the new update. The software is really smooth on both, with a plethora of customization features. Personally I would go for the honor, it has a better display, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, 3D face unlock, and doesn't have overheating issues. Additionally the honor runs of snapdragon 8 elite, which is more stable, and would last in the long run. 
Honestly, the oppo quick button isn't really practical, it can only launch the camera app, and zoom, which isn't really something most people would use. But the alert slider is the only thing i think is better than the honor.

I was going to get it but decided not to because of the downgrade , I have the Honor Magic 5 Pro ... What I've seen is this the Magic 7 Pro did not pass the shielding test in the UK/EU so Honor had Two options completely change the inside of the the shielding or put a smaller battery inside , they decided to take the cheaper option and downgrade the battery... The Honor magic 6 pro had a bigger battery with no problems and many makes of phone have a bigger battery in the UK/EU and to top it off when the Honor Magic 7 Pro was released in the UK/EU the CEO of Honor resigned , bit strange that , so if it's true about the Shielding on the Honor Magic 7 Pro then it's Honors mistake not the UK/EU regulations..I have never know a new flagship phone with any make get a smaller battery than the years before flagship it's either the same size or bigger never less..

I am a user that comes from the Find X2 Pro, then the Find X5 Pro, and now X8 Pro. And sadly the speaker quality has been going down with each new version. What happened is that.

For example, simple TikToks make the speakers crack in a way, but it's funny because I played a TikTok on the app and it sounds with speaker cracks or something like that. And then I download the same TikTok and play it from the gallery, and even with the volume fully up, it sounds clear. So I don't understand what's the problem with that or how to fix it. 

Also, in general, the speakers are not that great when I play music or anything, so it's a little bit annoying. I ended up downloading an equalizer that works on the entire system, but I don't think it fixes much of the problem. So I'm still waiting for some software update that corrects the audio quality or at least makes the settings for it uniform on the entire system.

I know someone who has a 2K screen and comparing them side by side there isn't much difference unless I put my face 2 inches from the screen and count pixels. The fingerprint is pretty fast but obviously the ultrasonic would be better. The cameras are far better in the X8 Pro especially the 6x zoom. The performance is great, I've played a few games and experienced no throttling nor overheating (must be the 9400 chip working wonders) and it's super fast. Aside from that, there aren't huge differences between the two. The find x8 Pro has a sleeker more premium look than the OP13. I'm not a fan of the off center camera bump on the OP13.
