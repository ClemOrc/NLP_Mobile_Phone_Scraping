iPhone16Pro,Camera Button Slanted on Pro Max?,"Got a 16 Pro Max last Saturday and I just noticed that the camera button is put in slightly slanted with the “bottom half” popping out above the cutout while the “top half” of the button is below the cutout. At first I didn’t think much about it but it quickly started annoying me whenever I scrolled on it while taking pictures and feeling the difference lol, would it be crazy to ask for a swap?",2025-02-06 14:35:41,2025-02-06,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone16Pro/comments/1ij3xk9/camera_button_slanted_on_pro_max/
iPhone16Pro,16Pro so lag! Just want my 13P back!,"My brand new 16Pro has been laggy/glitchy since I got it and it’s driving me crazy.  When I open the screen it glitches hard, and moving between apps causes glitches. Inside apps glitch.  Webpages lag when scrolling. This model has some serious bugs they need to work out. Additionally, the touchscreen programming is all jacked; they definitely changed the way it reacts to touches. I can barely type a word anymore without a mistake, and really struggle to highlight/copy/paste text. Constantly click on wrong links. How did they get this phone so wrong?

My 4-year old 13Pro was absolutely flawless. It ran circles around the 16P (except camera quality).  

And before anyone jumps to “user error” or “try clearing the cache” BS realize that I’m comparing it to my 13P set up the exact same way.",2025-02-06 13:29:34,2025-02-06,0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone16Pro/comments/1ij2jop/16pro_so_lag_just_want_my_13p_back/

iPhone16Pro,Screen doesn't register touch sometimes,"Im noticing from this past month that sometimes my screen doesn't register touch when i try to press to preview notification on the lockscreen.

But after unlocking and use the phone, it doesn't happen again, It happens randomly.

  
Does anyone else experiencing this? I thought it could be palm rejection issue that was discussed when the phone was released but it only started to happen now to me and even when i'm not using the space near the camera button.

Aesthetically, they felt too similar.

However, after testing multiple cases, it finally clicked when I got a clear case. That’s when the real color truly popped—it’s not just gold! It has this beautiful orangey hue with hints of gold, pink, and latte vibes. What you see in the advertisements of the color will really show.

iPhone16Pro,Recieved my 16 pro max and Google Pixel 9 pro.. hard to pick.,"Recieved both. It's hard to decide which to actually keep.

The 16 pro max is 500 euro more than the pixel both feel really nice in the hand..

at times iOS as a android user it feels a bit annoying with all the animations etc which i disabled, I like the password manager, the notifications annoy me especially discord when someone spams me i recieve a notifcation for every message while android just does it once and then never again. The slide down menu i keep having a war with it, it's just like from the network bar to the right side of the screen and i keep failing it to pull it down, I get stuck in a loop of opening the wrong thing I want XD.. I kinda also uninstalled most of apples stuff and installed chrome, gmail etc. 

Pixel is cool it feels really clean like the glossy sides android is android i used a pixel7 pro so basically its the same phone just different exterior and some internals os wise all the same. It feels familiar I know what to do where to go etc..

Camera wise it's hard to compare them depending on the scenario both are really incredible. The pixel does have this issue with brightness coming through a window or something where it tends to make pictures blurry or its magically putting light that doesnt exist. Sharpness wise they keep alternating sometimes pixel is better sometimes the iphone is better.. 

It's really hard to pick I was contemplating the S25 ultra also as a middle ground since thats what people call that phone but not a fan of the aesthetic choices of it lol",2025-01-31 21:12:58,2025-01-31,0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone16Pro/comments/1iephs0/recieved_my_16_pro_max_and_google_pixel_9_pro/
iPhone16Pro,iPhone 16 pro max display is warm and not that sharp.,"I have gone through all the discussions around iPhone screens being too warm (yellowish) and the fact that Apple uses screens from multiple vendors (LG, Samsung, etc).

Mine is a G9P (Samsung) display and I had started to accept the fact that display is what it is in terms of warm colours.

But after a few days, I started realising that this display isn’t as sharp as the S24/25Ultra, OnePlus 12/13 either 🥲 I mean if I am looking at a bird photo then I could see even the minute details of small feathers in Samsung and OnePlus but Apple seems to be lagging behind. It could majorly be because they have more PPI than 16PM.

iPhone16Pro,Some Apple silicone case glazing rq,"I heard nothing but complaints about this case before I actually got it. “It collects so much dust” “It breaks down so fast” “It has no grip” “It doesn’t protect the phone” ETC. 

Well I’ve had it since January 9th, and so far it’s been far and away the best case I’ve ever used. I’ve used mostly Otterbox in the past and this clears those. 

The grip and texture is fantastic, I’ve dropped my phone 2-3 times since I got it and neither the phone or case were damaged, the screen and camera lips are both great and I can sit face down either direction without any fear of scratches… and the color is fantastic. Camera Control works as if I wasn’t using a cover at all. It’s great.

I have met people with the older 12-14 versions of this case and it’s clearly a different material and slightly older design, so it’s not that all the people complaining are completely off-base. But I think Apple has made some really good changes this year, and I would comfortably recommend this case to anyone who wants a Camera Control button or a sleek, official case that doesn’t add a ton of bulk.",2025-01-31 18:21:10,2025-01-31,76,22,https://i.redd.it/zqubx184gdge1.jpeg

iPhone16Pro,16 pro max 3 months experience (read first),"I’ve had the 16 pro max since November, i upgraded from a 13 pro max and may i say the difference was pretty unexpected.

Main differences i’ve experienced so far:

• camera button, the more you fidget with it the more you will get used to all the functionalities it has and the feeling itself of the button . (Pro tip, remove the camera shortcut in your lock screen and the camera app from your home screen to get used to it instantly)

• a more stable pro motion display, the 13 pro max was the first pro motion display iPhone ever released and may i say, the difference is kinda wild because on the 13 pro max i would get weird frame drops on the screen and pro motion wasn’t really that optimised. Now i can say i am finally enjoying the pro motion display experience

• camera quality of course, it’s a pretty huge bump for me because i switched from a 12mp triple setup to a 48mp and 5x telephoto which really makes the difference. Moreover the lights and overall quality of the pictures is incredibly better.

• battery duration, holy cow if this was a change. I had to charge my 13 pro max 2/3 times in a day because i couldn’t go from 6am to 13pm with a full charge and i had to always have a battery pack with me.  The 16 pro max can go a full day or two without any charge because even tho i play some heavy games and do a lot of work it just keeps up really well with the battery and after 100 charge cycles it hasn’t dropped even 1% in battery health, i saw other people saying after 100cycles it dropped but it’s probably people who don’t understand how to treat you battery properly

 • last but not least the size, people may say that they don’t really see the difference but trust me there is a pretty big difference between the two phones and you can “feel” it in a daily use",2025-01-30 11:18:38,2025-01-30,82,42,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1idkrpu

iPhone16Pro,iPhone 16 Pro Max: Tipps für bessere Feuerwehr-Einsatzvideos bei Nacht?,"Hey Leute,

ich filme regelmäßig Feuerwehr-Übungen für den Social-Media-Kanal mit meinem iPhone 16 Pro Max, vor allem bei Nacht bzw im Dunklen. 

Dabei habe ich immer wieder zwei Probleme:

1. **Blaulicht-Spiegelungen** – Das Licht reflektiert sich stark und überstrahlt oft das Bild. Dadurch gehen viele Details verloren.
2. **Schlechte Nachtqualität** – Trotz der ""guten Kamera"" wirken die Videos oft zu dunkel oder haben viel Rauschen.

Ich habe schon mit den Kameraeinstellungen (Belichtung, HDR, Nachtmodus) herumprobiert, aber noch nicht die perfekte Lösung gefunden. Hat jemand von euch Erfahrung damit oder Tipps, wie man Blaulicht sauber einfängt, ohne dass es alles überstrahlt? Vielleicht spezielle Apps oder Einstellungen?

oder gibt es Möglichkeiten Filter vor die Linse zu machen? 

Danke für jeden Tipp!

  
Hey everyone,

I regularly film firefighter training exercises for our social media channel using my iPhone 16 Pro Max, especially at night or in low-light conditions. However, I keep running into two major issues:

1. **Blue light reflections** – The emergency lights reflect heavily and often overexpose parts of the image, making it hard to capture details.
2. **Poor night quality** – Despite the ""great camera,"" the videos often appear too dark or have a lot of noise.

I've already tried adjusting the camera settings (exposure, HDR, night mode), but I haven’t found the perfect solution yet. Does anyone have experience with this or tips on how to capture emergency lights properly without overexposure? Maybe specific apps or settings?

Or are there any filters I could put in front of the lens to improve the footage?

iPhone16Pro,Camera Settings Help,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been exploring the camera settings on my iPhone 16 Pro, and I’d love some advice on the best way to configure the Pro Formats. There are quite a few options, and I want to make sure I’m using the most effective settings without making things too complicated.

\-Between HEIF Max and ProRAW Max, which one offers the best balance of quality and convenience?

\-In the Apple ProRAW settings, there are different choices like JPEG Lossless, XL Lossless, and XL Lossy—which one is the most practical for everyday use?

A few things to consider:

\-I edit photos directly in the iPhone’s Photos app and don’t use Lightroom or any external software (for now).

\-I’m looking for high-quality images that are easy to adjust without taking up excessive storage.

\-I enjoy using Photographic Styles and would like to keep them if possible.

What settings would you recommend for the best balance between quality, flexibility, and ease of use? Any insights would be really helpful!

iPhone16Pro,Upgrading from 13 Pro was a mistake,"My wife and I had two paid off 3 year old 13 Pros on our Verizon plan, battery health was at 75% and was having to charge it 3-4 times a day which was getting annoying but other than that the phones were fine. I figured the couple hundred bucks we'd be out to replace both batteries wouldn't really be worth it since typically with every other iPhone, around 3 years with the phone was when we'd usually upgrade and the improvements made to the newer devices would always justify the upgrade. Upgrading from the 6S to the X was mind blowing, then the X to the 13 pro, equally impressive. 

Our 3 years with the 13 pro was up, Verizon offered us 800 for each so we initiated the trade in. As soon as I took the 16 pro out of the box my gut reaction was nice phone but the upgrade felt pointless, I held out for a week to use the new phone and see how things went. After a week it became clear that the phone wasn't much faster, same size and weight, no real improvements to interface, the camera button feels like a bit of a gimmick and I prefer the switch to the new action button. For some reason this phone feels very clunky and buggy compared to the old one. With the AI features (which seem pretty half baked atm) and always on screen enabled the battery life is noticeably worse than the 13 pro was before the battery degraded, so I turned AI off. I charged it overnight and it's 2PM and this phone is already at 60%, I'll have to charge it again before we go to the gym tonight. For the first 2 years I had the 13 pro I was only charging it every day and a half basically. 

My wife dropped off the old phones today and I immediately regretted it. She went back into the store right after and asked the rep if we could reverse the transaction, return the 16 Pros and get our 13 pros back and he said once it was entered into the system they had no way to reverse it. 

It feels so stupid to be locked into the bill credits for 3 years and stuck on the premium plan for these new phones when there's really nothing about them that improves on what we had.

iPhone16Pro,Dbrand Ghost Case 2.0 (MagSafe version),"I ordered the original cases a while ago for a different phone. Because of all issues people were having with scratched cases out of the box, general easy scratching, defects like the edge separating from the main body of the case and MagSafe rings being misaligned on other devices, they released a 2.0 version and allowed people that purchased the original to get a free replacement.  Mine just arrived. 

If you haven’t heard of Dbrand they make skins and some light mods for various devices, as well as some accessories.  

The perks of this case are their claims that it will not yellow.  That remains to be seen, they have also adjusted their manufacturing process to make these cases a bit more scratch resistant than the last one. We will see. 

Now that it’s in my hand (again), despite it being on a different device than last time it feels very light. The edge is quite grippy with a decent button press response. The dedicated camera button is also responsive to half presses and touch gestures.  It feels different enough that one should have no issues finding it just by touch. 

If I wasn’t running a screen protector the lip on the front would be more pronounced but right now it BARELY sits above the screen protector I’m using. It so little that it may as well be not worth mentioning that it does at all.  

MagSafe performance isn’t the strongest I have experienced but definitely not the weakest.  

Would I recommend it? Eh, I have a hard time recommending any case over 25 bucks.  But the build is decent. ",2025-01-22 08:08:55,2025-01-22,59,19,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i76cp5

Then once it's installed the whole device feels slower I don't know if it's still processing something or what, then face id bugged out not unlocking even when the read animation plays. Then I reboot and that's fixed but sound control is gone from control center like what? That's so random.

iPhone16Pro,Overheating iPhone 16 pro! ,"Kind of over the last two model of these iPhones. Had this heating issue with iPhone 15 pro and now with the iPhone 16 pro. Updated it a while ago and since then the phone heat’s up worse than it did before the update for no reason. Phone would be done any background updates at this point. Just scrolling, or multi tasking through apps and the phone heats up. Watching videos on YouTube, the phone heats up. On a phone call, and the phone heats up. Just day to day stuff and it heats up. Looking through pictures on my camera roll for 5 mins and phone heats up. It’s like a mini fire place attached to my hands. The last good phone I had from iPhone is the 11/12 to be honest. I am not the only one noticing this, and my battery isn’t defective. They need to do better at this point. A phone shouldn’t be heating up like this just from doing day to day tasks. Plus, I barely even use my phone all that much, so I would hate to see what happened if I used it extensively if it can’t even get through watching a 30 minute YouTube video without it heating up.  I am also very diligent with how I care for the battery. The reason I always opted for iPhone over android was because androids used to be notorious for heating up. And, iPhones never used to have this issue.",2025-01-20 23:42:42,2025-01-20,2,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone16Pro/comments/1i64sdy/overheating_iphone_16_pro/

One thing I'm missing is Android's ability to increasing scaling by setting a slightly larger value for ""Smallest width"" setting in Developer options. This made everything look slightly small, similar ti MacBook's display scaling. Is there no similar option on iPhone?

I've already set text size to smallest and there isn't a negative zoom option in accessibility. The text size change did help a bit, but apps, keyboard etc are quite large. I prefer smaller, more dense UI if there's any way to achieve it?

iPhone16Pro,Did I get a faulty one? ,"Hi all,

I've got my 16 pro in december, after using android for my whole life, and for the first 3 weeks of ownership is not without flaws.

First of all, carplay worked once, or twice, and most of the time it's only circling through connect-disconnect-connect-disconnect in like 10 sec intervals, so it's unusable. Tried other cables, all resulted in the same behavior so I guess, the USB-C port on the device might be faulty. (At least the data-transfer lines).  


Next issue, is that it's randomly shutting down. And if it shuts down, I don't have anything from 30 sec before. So for example, I'm in a call with 40% battery left, it turns off, and when I turn it back on it does not show the call i was in in the logs, furthermore, once it turned off while I was taking photos while on call, and those photos didn't save. I couldn't find them anywhere (neither the call in the logs).

Not to mention the other bugs that more people encounter, like the random max volume bug and stuff.

So what's the verdict? May I return it and ask for a replacement?",2025-01-18 20:53:34,2025-01-18,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone16Pro/comments/1i4h4dp/did_i_get_a_faulty_one/

* Screen tap still feels most natural
* Dust is more annoying than expected

I'm using an iPhone 16 pro max from last 10 days and haven't installed many apps, in fact keeping the usage minimal, but am facing these issues along with some laggy gaming.

The back button isn't working properly for most times and am having to tap repetitively around the area to get decent functionality. I have learnt that swiping from left will take me a screen back, but still this issue is annoying and don't think that's how it's supposed to be.

Electrocuting, while being charged, touching camera or back area gave slight electric shocks.

Getting heated while using camera. I have barely clicked any pics in the last days, but even in that, a few mins of using camera or turning on torch is heating the phone area around them too much. Not sure, if that's how it is for everybody.

And lastly gaming. I have only installed and played Pokemon unite, but that seems to be laggy, I'm not expecting to game a lot on this, but given the specs, is that how it's supposed to be or am I looking at a possible defective piece?

The battery life on this replacement is worse than the damaged 16 pro it replaced. It arrived with roughly half a charge, with 100% battery health and zero cycles as expected. Date of manufacture is August 2024 so it’s actually a month older than the phone it replaced which was manufactured in September 2024, but that doesn’t seem like a big deal.

Sometimes it takes 10-15 seconds for the camera to open and about the same amount of time for the flash to turn on. It’s annoying as heck when you want to take a picture of a moment and can’t because the camera won’t open.

I finally contacted Apple Support yesterday and after some communication it sounded like the technician already knew about the issue. After being directed to a senior technician she suggested that I reset all settings, which I did. That fixed both issues… at least for now.

I’m going to guess it’s going to come back in a day or two- it did last week when I factory reset the phone (I set it up from scratch when I set it back up).

iPhone16Pro,Switched from SE 2020. ,"I thought I suck at taking photos. Turns out I was limited by the tech I got.

Can't stop taking photos of random stuff. Loving the high refresh rate (Dear Apple, regular users also deserves this, it's 2025, come on) and camera button is a cool gimmick that gets a bit time to adjust, but feels fine.

Battery life alone makes it an incredible level up for me, considering the 5 year old SE 2020. Was considering Pro Max just because of the extra juice but handled them both in the store and decided the almost similar size to my SE with centuries better of a display size, Pro would be more familiar. So I got the 256gb and some accesories instead of spending it to a naked Pro Max that I'll struggle during single handed use. I like my phone smaller than my eleventh toe.

Not even talking about Face ID. Nothing new, I know, but my greasy-sweaty skin was making me suffer during TouchID attempts.

iPhone16Pro,Why is the iPhone 11 camera lowkey better than the 16 Pro?,"Had the 16 Pro a week ago and I just can’t help to compare it with the previous 11.

Here’s several things I noticed about 16 Pro’s camera which I find odd. Because the 11 seems to do better in close-up, low-light pictures.

1st pic - iPhone 11
2nd pic - iPhone 16 Pro

1. Noticeable light flares on 16 Pro - look how everything on the second pic looks kinda blurry… especially anywhere near the edges of the image. I don’t have night mode on nor do I have macro shooting turned on; it’s weird that it slightly flares out anything far from the center. It’s pissing the soul out of me bc I like to take close-up pics and some parts look like they’re doubled (for example look at the Mac’s toolbar on the 2nd pic)

2. Noticeable curve on images on 16 Pro - look at the upper part of my Mac’s screen. The upper edges. My 11 doesn’t do that — it’s weird why the image looks sloped on my 16 Pro. For more context, look at the 3rd image - it’s like I shot something on a GoPro. The image looks weirdly spherical. 

3. Bad auto focus on 16 Pro - can’t explain it any further. The 11 just does a better job while the 16 Pro has a hard time to do focus on close up even when you tap the screen.

Setup looks clean with this case - especially appreciating how the camera bump protection doesn't add unnecessary bulk. The lens rings are precisely cut and that slight raised edge provides just enough protection.

iPhone16Pro,Has anyone found an app that works with the Camera Control feature that starts recording video upon launch?,"Has anyone found an app that the Camera Control works with that automatically starts recording video upon launch?

Hey everyone 👋 

So I noticed that in iOS 18.2 (and 18.2.1) when you press and hold on the Camera Control button long enough it starts to record video. Unfortunately you have to keep pressing down the button the entire time you want it to record. 

I thought that maybe this was a setting in the Settings > Camera > Camera Control menu, but unfortunately it isn’t. However when I was on this screen I saw a number of my camera apps showed up that I could make the Camera Control launch. 

This gave me an idea. If I can find an app that when you open it up it immediately, and without requiring any screen taps, started to record video—and that app showed up in the Camera Control menu—I could use my Camera Control button to launch directly into video record mode without having to hold down the button. 

My question to all of you is: Have you seen a camera app that has the option to immediately start recording video upon launch? I don’t mind paying for the app (but a one time payment, I have so many subscriptions I can’t handle another 😂). Any ideas would be appreciated! 

✌️ 

P.S. I know I could create a Shortcut that opens the camera and starts recording and assigning it to the action button, but I already have that button assigned to a task so that won’t work. 🫤",2025-01-11 16:13:58,2025-01-11,3,0,https://i.redd.it/1a80h5w63ece1.jpeg

iPhone16Pro,Photos app randomly removes ability to edit Styles after taking them on some photos,"I don't think there's a solution for this (but if there is, I'd love to know), I believe it's a bug and I've reported it to Apple via one method and will continue to via others, and recommend others who experience this do, and if you don't know you check and see if it is happening to you and report it.

I'm running 18.2.1 but I believe I noticed this before that update. I have no problem with the new Photographic Styles in the Camera app, but the Photos app on my Iphone is randomly not allowing me to edit Photographic Styles AFTER TAKING THEM on photos that it should -- photos where you can see in the Information the style they were originally taken with and are therefore the correct type etc. 

I haven't done a wide survey but in the last day or so anyway it appears that this bug thankfully might not be happening for 0.5x (Ultrawide Lens) and 1x (Telephoto Lens) if taken in HEIF Max at 48MP. But I've seen it for regular HEIF & HEIF MAX at every magnifications and any other MP amount (12, 24, etc.) randomly have this happen -- including if they were taken with any of the 3 lenses. 

It doesn't seem to happen all the time or most of the time and is totally random when this happens from one photo to the next. I thought a hard reset fixed it once but that definitely is not the case. It is very frustrating!

I actually just posted this as a Bug Report at this Apple Feedback link as well at this link:

iPhone16Pro,iPhone 16 pro hardware and software issues,"Hi guys

I have iphone 16 pro from the first of october and I noticed some problems.

I have problems with shield glass. After using a phone for a month I noticed that phone has few small and one quiet big scratch. I really take care of the phone, it's in the case since the day one it's always secured in my pocket, no keys or similar things that can scratch it. Before 16 pro I had iphone 13 since it came out and it has less scratches than this one. This is the first time I put protective glass on my phone and I hate it but I had no choice.

Also I have problem with touch screen. A lot of times my phone does not register touch screen I need to press on it multiple times.

Not so many times but few times I had problem with camera, it glitches when I enter it and I need to reenter so it can start working.

Last but not least most of the times, when I wake my screen(press power button or tap to wake) my screen first apear like in minimum brihtness or like it turns on always on display with wallpaper on and than after a second or two it fully turns on. Like it has two steps of turning on display.

I saw on youtube that a lot of people have same problems as I do so I was wondering does anybody know are thoes problems sotfware or hardware. Did anyone contact the apple about it and what was response?

iPhone16Pro,Benks ArmorAir - Initial Review,"I’m all about keeping my tech sleek and efficient. Sure, we all have our own ways, but this is how I do most things.

Now, the Benks ArmorAir is almost perfect, except for one tiny thing. But hey, I can live with that since it’s just a personal preference.

Look at it! The ArmorAir looks amazing. It’s modern, sleek, slim, and just plain classy. From the front to the back, the cutouts, and the camera protection - it screams minimalist with a touch of “car enthusiast.” As a car guy, I love carbon fiber, so this just works for me. I’d rate it 9/10.

Feel it! When you hold your iPhone 16 Pro with the Benks ArmorAir, it feels soft yet almost like you’re holding your phone without a case. It’s like a dream come true. For me, it’s not slippery, but I can see how some might think it is. I have smaller hands, and with this case, it just feels perfect. It might just be the most comfortable phone holding experience ever! Oh, and let’s not forget how it feels on the pinky while holding it. It’s insanely comfortable. No issues here. I’d say it’s as soft as a pillow, but it’s a case, so take that how you want. Rating: 9/10

Fit: It fits snugly like a glove. It might be a bit tricky to put the phone in and take it out, but the edges of the case hook onto the edge of the iPhone for an absolutely locked-in fit. No complaints here. In fact, it might be the best-fitting minimalist case I’ve had (Latercase and Reborn Device are the other two). Rating: 10/10

MagSafe: The MagSafe magnets are good. They’re not the strongest I’ve seen, but they’re still strong enough to support your MagSafe accessories. Attached to my ESR MagSafe car mount, it works great with big bumps and doesn’t even budge. Rating: 7.5/10 

I have a two changes to maybe make things better. First, I’d love to see a way to completely cover the camera lenses (my only unchecked box), like Latercase and the Reborn Device Gen 1. I’m not sure if this is possible, but I’d also love to see an option with aluminum buttons and camera control.

Overall, this case is almost perfect for those who want a minimalist, comfortable, modern, and classy case. At $40 USD, it’s definitely worth the price. 

TL:DR - The Benks ArmorAir is everything a minimalist wants/needs. ",2025-01-08 15:23:21,2025-01-08,15,20,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hwmmw4

iPhone16Pro,"Not going to lie, disappointed in the camera ","I just upgraded to my first iPhone in years, coming from a galaxy s23 ultra, and as a hobbyist photographer I’m a bit disappointed in the cameras on the 16 Pro Max. I’m surprised how little control the native camera app has for technical photography, no long exposing (I don’t count Live Photo here, because you cannot control it barely at all), no iso control, and one of the things I’m most missing is fine focus control. I do a lot of macro photography and being able to lock the focus on my Samsung phone was a really nice feature I used almost daily, and as far as I can tell there is no way to fine control the focal depth, without tapping on the object I want, which can be difficult on smaller objects.

On the bright side I really enjoy the portrait mode, and the low light pictures are very impressive, but I am a bit disappointed that I need to use a 3rd party app like Lightroom in order to have basic camera controls. 

Now don’t get me wrong, the cameras are great and you can get some really good pictures, I just feel much more limited than on my Samsung, and I feel like my galaxy was better for setting up a shot, and point and shooting.

if you want to use the camera control button, there is an option which SHOULDN'T be available in the normal camera mode - aperture. The Aperture feature in the main camera mode let every phone crash because the aperture only goes to 1,78 and with the camera control, it is possible to get a bigger aperture = crash. Maybe with a software update we get a adjustable Aperture (?) but atm it is just a lil malfunction by itself, because the aperture is fixed in the normal photo mode.

iPhone16Pro,15 pro max or 16 pro?,"I was initially going to purchase the 15 pro as my next phone from the 13 but unfortunately my local BB was out of stock. I was then offered a 15 pro max for $4/month extra monthly and I thought why not. Bigger screen, better battery, more storage, better cameras, and long story short: I like it

The screen isn’t too big for my hands, even though mine are average sized. Battery is great, cameras are good and promotion/always on display is useful. Natural titanium colour is beautiful too.

The dilemma I’m having is that BB is now offering the 16 pro for the same price, so I’m wondering if returning the 15 pro max and getting the 16 pro is worth it. My current storage being used is 130gb, so if i did get the 16 pro I’d have to empty some of my storage to be under the limit. BB also offers a lesser gift card for the 16 pro ($200-$250 compared to $300 for the 15 pro max)

iPhone16Pro,Photographic Styles + Fuji vibes,"Hey folks! 👋

Let me tell you about my situation: I have a Fuji X100V and I'm thinking about getting the iPhone 16 Pro since I need to change my phone.

What I absolutely love about the Fuji is that I can play around with film simulations (I come from analog photography). I really dig seeing how the photo turns out with the simulation in real-time - it's completely different from editing it afterwards!

I've looked online but couldn't find anyone who's tried to recreate looks like Portra 400 or Tri-X 400 using iPhone's Photographic Styles. Yeah, there are apps to do it in post, but I'd like to try and get something similar (not identical, just to be clear) directly with iPhone camera.

I know I can only save one custom style at a time, but I'd be happy to write down the settings for each style in the notes app or a shortcuts folder.

Has anyone experimented with this? Do you have any guides/videos/links to recommend?

Thanks a bunch! 🙏

P.S. I know it'll never be like a real Fuji simulation, but I'm curious to see how far I can push it",2024-12-30 09:58:23,2024-12-30,11,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone16Pro/comments/1hpjzxj/photographic_styles_fuji_vibes/

I mean on YouTube bloggers testing 16 Pro Max - it could last easily for 12 hours permanent video playing on YT. Many people report battery lasts for day and a half with gaming, using YouTube and Instagram. 

Is it really okay for the battery on the brand new phone that could barely last 24 hours with simple usage without even YT, TikTok or Instagram ?!

iPhone16ProMax,Can anyone recommend a case with both button and camera lens covers?,"Hello,

I just got a new phone for the first time in 6 years. Pardon my stupidity, but I need help with what case to get.

Can anyone recommend a case that has both button covers, for all of the buttons (and not a cut out), as well as a camera lens cover (it can open via hinge, or snap on and off. I’m not too picky, I just want the entire phone protected, buttons, lenses, and all).

Drop protection is important, but I don’t need it for extreme height; just enough durability in case it falls out of my pocket on some hard stairs or sidewalk. 

I watched MobileReviewsEh on YouTube who suggested FLOLAB as his #1 case choice for the iPhone 16 Pro Max. I like his reasons, including that it has all the buttons covered, but there is no camera lens cover. If it’s possible to buy a separate lens cover to fit with FLOLAB’s case, then I’ll go with FLOLAB (unless you feel this is not a good choice, that is).

Someone else mentioned ESR includes the camera lens cover with their case, via on a hinge which nicely doubles as a stand when opened. Does anyone recommend this case / brand, or no?

Does anyone have any other suggestions?

iPhone16ProMax,Need help regarding the battery,"I’ve been using the phone for 3 days already and so far the only issue I have encountered is the battery life - draining too quickly with usage from basic to none.

My phone had been on iOS 18.1 and today I updated it to 18.3. Some users say the battery has significantly improved but it’s too early for me to say, although I can feel a slight improvement already.

However, I’ve read about some possible solutions such as charging the phone a few times overnight in order to index the battery or doing a factory reset and manually instal the needed apps.

From what I understood, the latter is being done when the apps have been automatically transferred from the older phone beforehand (in my case an Android device) and that’s why the battery gets weak.

Can you give me an advice on how to proceed in order to fully enjoy my phone? Should I wait before doing anything?

AI is still not available where I live and I’ve never had an iPhone before. I set the charging limit up to 80% and I have WiFi and 5G turned off. If any of that matters.

iPhone16ProMax,Considering the switch…,"Hi folks,

I’ve always been an iPhone user until XR, then I tried Android and lately I’ve returned to iPhone because I thought, and I still think, that third-party apps are simply more polished and optimized, but there are many things (regarding software) that I find better on Android. In addition, I don’t like iOS 18 at all since I had some issues. 

N.B. I’m not into mobile gaming and at the moment I don’t have other Apple devices. 

Therefore I’m considering to switch to Pixel Pro 9 XL. Did anybody do the same change?

If yes, I’d like to know how 9 Pro XL behaves regarding:

1) **battery life**: I bought the 16 Pro Max because I’ve read that battery life was incredible, but I don’t find that to be the case

2) **photos** I’m an amateur photographer and I like especially to take pictures of landscapes. I’m wondering also how 9 Pro XL scores regarding night/low light photos

3) does using the Pixel during the night cause eyestrain?

And here are the results: 
Saturday (Post 6:30P.M) : 1hr SOT
Sunday : 4hrs 15min SOT 
Monday (Running) : 2 and half hours SOT 

And note, at the time of writing Im left with 22%. 

So including SOT and Screen Idle time, I'm getting almost 10+ hrs and with 22% left, I can drag it down to 13hrs maybe?

No BT **on Pen?**  
**Same form as Iphone?**  
**alot is starting to look like apples way** 

and Iphone just Works, flawless!  
i myself have had ZERO issues, and the customer service has been insane good, i had to talk to them one time after i did not find a setting i needed.

yeah, mby samsung has good PRE ORDER deals, all fun and games inntill u need customer service, that is horrendus !  
i have struggeld SO hard with that over the years, they give a TOTAL F, even in my Countrey where there is very strict rules about handling stuff like that.

iPhone16ProMax,My solution to my battery & performance woes ,"I know, it’s a dreaded battery post. For those who have nothing positive to say, just move and and ignore, but for those of you having issues with battery drain listen on. 

I bought my phone on launch day and even from the first week I noticed something wasn’t right and my battery was draining very quickly. I don’t game often on my phone and it was just churning through battery on safari, Apple Music, the homescreen, and other apple stock apps. 

  
I contacted Apple support several times over the next months, but they all ran diagnostics and said nothing was wrong with my battery. It was around January that I also began noticing my phone was heating up just browsing on safari and the frame rate was noticably dropping.

Things I tried = 

* Resetting all settings 
* Restoring from backup 
* Restoring from FRESH install from my Mac 
* Force restarts 
* Augmenting settings (background app refresh, notifications, Siri etc) 

  
I presented to the Apple Store and they made me do another restore from their Mac and sent me to see if it would fix it, it obviously didn’t. One week later I went back and requested a replacement, but was originally told I needed to send it for servicing. I stated my consumer rights that the phone was not working as advertised and displayed several issues and finally they replaced it.

  
I am now only 1 day later, even with installing all my new apps and “indexing” which everyone always states is the issue for battery woes, and already it is INFINITELY better. 

  
I have used the phone all morning, listening to music and cooking, watching videos, acrued 4 hours of screen on time and 9 hours of idle time and I’m still at 80%. I haven’t noticed any performance issues as well. 

  
Do not let the “just go touch grass” and “it’s your usage” people get you down, make an appointment with your Apple Store, show them the evidence of the poor usage and hopefully utilize your consumer protection laws to get a replacement. 

  
Tldr - Had issues with battery life and performance and none of the usual fixes helped. Used my consumer rights to request a replacement and it has fixed all my issues. 

  
Thanks for listening and hope y’all are enjoying these great devices :) ",2025-01-19 06:17:13,2025-01-19,21,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone16ProMax/comments/1i4s4yu/my_solution_to_my_battery_performance_woes/

iPhone16ProMax,Battery issues ,"Hello everyone! Over the holidays, I got myself an iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, I didn’t have time to wait over 4 hours to transfer all the data from my iPhone 13 Pro Max to the new phone. While I was at the store, I activated the phone, checked to make sure everything was working properly, and then put it back in the box.

Three weeks later (this week), I finally had the time to set everything up. I charged the 16 Pro Max, reset it to make the transfer process smoother, and successfully transferred all my data.

Unfortunately, I’ve noticed that the battery isn’t lasting as long as I expected. I’m not sure if it’s because I’ve been using cellular data instead of Wi-Fi, or if there’s another reason, but it definitely doesn’t seem to last as long as my 13 Pro Max did when I first got it.

iPhone16ProMax,Battery not as good as i thought it would be coming from 13PM ,"So last week i traded in my 13 Pro Max for the 16 Pro Max since it's basically free with the AT&T $1,000 promotion. My first impression after a week with the phone is that the battery life is no where near as good as my old 13PM and the brand new 16PM battery is performing about the same as my 13PM right before i traded it in at 85%. It most certainly is not performing as well or better than the 13PM with a new battery that's for sure. For reference, I am a heavy  user with 10-12 hours of screen time a day (mostly checking stocks on Robinhood and scrolling Twitter and Outlook 365). With the 16PM, i  wake up at around 7AM and by 4PM it's at 20%. This is almost exactly what i would get from my 13PM with an 85% battery and the 13PM with a new battery would not touch 20% until it was almost bed time. Anyone else having a similar experience?

  
UPDATE: After another a week the phone is performing much better and as i would expect a brand new iphone with a huge battery to perform.

Rear cameras work fine, making videos too. My 15 Pro Max had no problems with selfies, I'm getting it for the first time using a phone. Any idea how to fix this?

iPhone16ProMax,Just not acceptable!! (18.1.1 & 18.2.1),"It appears that I am simply seeing a lot of issues with my new 16 Pro Max, which has negatively impacted my experience.It isn't getting any better after I got a replacement because the previous one's hardware was defective.I discovered three problems: 


1. The Home Screen displays a blank loading screen when you scroll sideways. As a QA engineer, I believe I have identified the problem.If you happen to click on Apple TV while scrolling, you will see the loading screen, and the app will crash and go to the lock screen.That's just my opinion; I'm not an Apple guy

2. Your passcode is required to enable Face ID randomly on the Lock Screen .It happened on IOS version (18.1.1)
My Observation- It seems to  be the IOS (18.1.1) issue and didn’t occurred in 18.2.1 yet ✌️

3. You recently changed your passcode.Enter your new passcode to unlock IPhone (18.2.1)
My Observation - Suspecting it as a 18.2.1 

It just seems that I am observing this much because this is my first pro series iPhone  and I am paying close attention of them as I am too a QA engineer as a professional .😂😭

iPhone16ProMax,Just switched back to iPhone after 4 years of Android with the 16 Pro Max. I really like the direction apple is going in now.,"Back in 2020 i switched from an iphone 6s to a motorola android phone and didn’t look back. I’d always hated how locked down ios was compared to android and I had always wanted to make the switch. I then got an S22 ultra, still happy with my switch.

In the past few years however i’ve slowly seen ios morph from something with way less features than mainstream android to something comparable, even superior in many ways feature wise (even if it still lags behind in others). Apple being forced to adopt USB C especially is what made me go from “I’m never switching back” to “maybe i could consider it”.

Newer releases have made ios go from bland in my eyes to striking and customizable. Especially since when i switched ios didn’t even have widgets.

Got a very good trade in deal for my s22 ultra and decided to get a 16 pro max. I’m kind of blown away by how different ios feels now. This is the only device i own that actually supports the latest ios (only other device i have that isnt my iphone 6s or extremely old is an ipad 5th gen), and now I simply don’t feel limited like I have by other apple devices.

I still really like samsung but this phone is even more of a beast than my s22 ultra was. I also forgot how nice things like imessage and facetime were. As much as i like oneui, ios animations and ui fluidity are just miles above what android as an operating system is capable of on any device. It takes a lot of software trickery for companies like samsung to make UIs that can even sort of compete. And there’s a ton of small features, especially interconnection between devices, that android can’t even touch. FaceID is awesome too, they’ve improved it by a ton since i last tried it.

There’s still some small things i’ll miss, but i’m overall very happy with my return to iphone and i’ll probably stay with it for my next phone in a few years. Feels completely different to the ios i left behind, but also the same in all the right ways. Just wanted to share my experiences for anyone else curious about the switch.

EDIT: Another huge upgrade I missed: Battery life! I had the S22 Ultra from before qualcomm realized samsungs silicon foundries are garbage, so the battery life, while not bad at all, wasn’t great for a modern phone. As someone used to hand-me-down devices (and who has a purse that I keep a battery bank in), I wasn’t too critical about it. Now, though, I haven’t even needed to use my battery bank. I know newer samsung phones have greatly improved on this but it’s still not as good as iphone.

Also samsung phones straight up will not charge with slow chargers while doing anything, simply die more slowly. This is really annoying in my car because it can’t actually charge the phone while in android auto. iPhone doesn’t even slightly have this issue.

I also basically wrote off camera control as a gimmick before i even thought of getting a new phone, but i've liked it a lot so far. i don't use the zoom that much but a dedicated camera/shutter button that lets me keep my action button free for a flashlight control and that nicely matches with my right hand is great.",2025-01-09 00:32:32,2025-01-09,11,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone16ProMax/comments/1hwzvao/just_switched_back_to_iphone_after_4_years_of/

iPhone16ProMax,Confused between buying the new S25 Ultra or go for the 16 Pro Max ,"I am an android phone user since last 14 years, have been used samsung,moto and oneplus phones since last decade.
Currently using OnePlus 7 pro which I got on launch day in 2019.
Earlier used samsung notes, OnePlus 3,etc.

Planning to get a new flagship device the coming month,
But I have been using many apple products since last 5 years - I own an iPad Air , Macbook air M3 and Airpods Pro 2nd gen  and found the apple ecosystem to be good and refined with some restrictions, but still more or less seamlessly integrated and gets the work done.

Now I am confused that shall I go for the upcoming S25 ultra or get the 16 pro max.
My priority is the device should have a good battery life, durable with good build, good cameras ,smooth UIX, good display and longevity.. should last minimum 4 years without any major issues like green lines or sudden crashes,lags, motherboard issues etc to name a few.
Heard samsung doesn't replace the phones display even after green line issues were found in Indian flagship devices 
(I am from India)

Having been invested in apple ecosystem in the other devices, getting the pro max makes sense but the only thing holding me is that will I be able to get used to iOS and some restrictions as I am very comfortable using Android phones.


PS - My whole family uses iphone and they think that spending that much money on samsung flagship is not worth it when u have other devices of apple ecosystem.
I have used iPhones in my house but never as a primary device.
All inputs are welcome 
I am not an apple or samsung fanboy neither I am biased towards any brand.

Unfamiliar with wireless charging situation. I have always used wired charging on my 13 Pro - felt wireless magsafe charging to be gimmicky and damaging to battery health over extended use. Is there benefit in getting wireless chargers?

iPhone16ProMax,Recording audio (direct feed into iPhone) with video,"
Ok; am thinking this is an issue that others may have already reported. 

I took delivery of a new 16 pro max a few days ago. An upgrade from my old 11 pro max.

I record and video/stream dj sets for social media and soundcloud. On my 11 pro max I did this by sending the output from my mixer into an audio interface (Art Cleanbox Pro). The sound was then sent from that, via a 3.5mm RCA, into my phone using a Rode TRRS connector into a lightning adaptor - into the phone.

On my 11 pro max this worked brilliantly. I assumed that for it to work the same on my new 16 pro max, all I needed to do was purchase a TRRS to USB C adaptor. Have done this and tried it out.

At first the sound was very quiet and muffled - but I had kept the sound levels on my mixer and Cleanbox Pro at the previous settings that worked for my 11 pro max. Fair enough - I increased the levels. Got them to the desired volume, ensuring they’re not too high as to distort. But the sound is still very muffled - to the point where it sounds almost underwater, or recorded in a large room. Definitely not clear or of a quality to be able to use.

The phone is picking up the direct sound input - I test this by turning my speakers up/silent. This makes no diff to the finished video, so I know the USB C input is sending audio into the phone.

Have checked out solutions online - have made sure my camera is recording stereo (not spacial) etc. Is there anything else I should be doing in settings?

Reading others’ comments I’ve seen there seems to be an issue with the 16 pro max recording direct sound input when recording video - is this correct? 

This is massively inconvenient - recording/streaming music video is the biggest use I have for my phone.  

Is this a known 16 pro max issue and can it be fixed? ",2025-01-07 11:02:09,2025-01-07,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone16ProMax/comments/1hvp0c2/recording_audio_direct_feed_into_iphone_with_video/

iPhone16ProMax,"Is this normal OLED behavior, or should I be concerned? (iPhone 16 Pro Max)","I recently noticed some horizontal banding on my iPhone 16 Pro Max’s display (I bought it 2 weeks ago), but it’s only visible at low brightness (30% and lower) with dark gray backgrounds. It stands out enough to catch my eye, especially in dim lighting, but I’m curious if this is typical for OLED screens or something that could worsen over time.

For reference:
- The banding seems most noticeable in dim lighting conditions.
- My brother has the same phone, but his screen doesn’t show the same effect. We use the same type of screen protector. His phone's manufacturing date is more recent than mine.
- I'm on iOS 18.2. I don't remember if I had it with 18.0, maybe I wasn't noticing then.
- I had a similar issue with OLED on my old galaxy phone, but in the form of a large elongated patch of uneven brightness when displaying dim gray backgrounds.

iPhone16ProMax,"Just to let y’all know the difference for once and for all, hopefully …","Since there are countless battery “drain” posts daily which are overwhelmingly annoying by now, let me explain something. Your network type/signal affects about 90% of how long your battery lasts a day. It’s the proven biggest factor, then it’s the apps you use and how long you use them. This is my comparison in 2 screenshots. When I’m on WiFi all day at home (first screenshot) I get about 9 hours of SoT before I plug it in at about 30% juice left. And when I’m on 5GUW Mobile Data (second screenshot) I get about 7 hours. Remember not everyone’s experience is the same, it never will. We all have different usage patterns, apps, cell phone/home internet providers, 4G/5G tower signal reception, etc. and that is not Apple’s hardware or iOS software’s fault, unless it’s a widespread experience problem. They have 0 control about third party companies and applications battery consumption. They provide the device, while others provide the service. So stop panicking and worrying about your battery life, enjoy your phone unless it completely turns off on you after 2 hours of using it, then run to the Apple Store and demand an exchange. But if your phone lasts until you plug it in before going to sleep, it’s perfectly fine, there’s no actual “drain” happening. So just to recap, WiFi vs. Cellular makes about 2-3 hour in screen on time difference, then it’s your app usage, and it’s individual consumption. This monster has the best battery in any flagship out there right now, shoot my 16PM even beats my girlfriend’s S24 Ultra, which has a bigger battery, by a landslide lol.

I can push it down but it will lift back up after a few seconds. If I try putting more pressure on the lifting edge it creates an air bubble about a half inch in. Is it possible that the front glass on the phone is defective/slightly warped causing this issue?

Can anyone talk about their experience?

Edit for summary: 
Thanks to everyone that responded. I’ve decided not to upgrade. The general consensus is that it’s not worth it, unless I have a specific purpose  (e.g. tech people, those that need the best camera possible, those that need the longest lasting battery). Also, almost nobody saw much value in the new camera slide. 

One indicated the upgrade was worth it because lots of 15PM faults got fixed in the 16 and all the improvements really added up to a better phone. 

Finally, I wasn’t asking about upgrading every year, or mindless consumerism. It’s just that people that give cash for Christmas like to see you buy something rather than put it in the bank.

iPhone16ProMax,Two things I noticed in 16PM,"Hi there

I noticed 2 things in 16PM, I don’t know if it is a software issue or hardware one!
The first is when I listen to a voice note or watch video inside WhatsApp the sound is low, when I open the same video from photo library the sound is much better, same thing happened to my wife’s iPhone 16PM. I’m on iOS 18.2 and she on iOS 18.1.

Also in camera app previously I used 14PM and if I in photo mode I can move the white button to right to record a video, now if I did this in 16PM it switch to video mode it make the recording angle big, but if you’re in photo mode then swipe the white button ( shutter) to right it will record a video with the same photo angle, I hope u guys understand me, English is not my native language.

iPhone16ProMax,Dear Battery Nerds,"Personally I, like many of the rest of you regular folk, am getting sick to death of the amount of “is my battery health ok” or “is this a normal amount of battery life vs screen time” posts. This isn’t titled the 16 pro max battery subreddit, the phones a new release and frankly, released with a lot of experimental features that are changing with each update, the battery will change as it learns your habits and the phone itself will follow suit and adapt. 

The really annoying thing to me is that unless you’re using your phone heavily for either work or like me, you have no life and use your phone a lot when off work, you don’t need screen on time of like 12 hours, your phone takes notifications and connects to shit and updates throughout the day, if you are at work and not using your phone, turn off your mobile data or turn off your phone until you need to use it and you’ll save precious battery life or better yet, considering you’ve dropped over £1000 on a damn phone, spend an extra 30-50 on a power bank, you can get the really slim ones that provide just about a full charge or get a monster one like mine if you’re a heavy user who goes on stupid long hikes/walks and tracks all your shit while videoing and playing music. I’ve attached my battery life and screen time, I use my phone over 12 hours a day and rarely need to charge more than once a day.

—- in a span of 24 hrs i had to charge my phone twice… (is it considerable judging my usage?)

2. Why does it say that it stopped charging due to temp (it was really supposed to stop at 90 bcos I set a charging limit) when the phone was actually really cool?

3. Is my Shortcuts using that chunk of a portion of my batt since I only have minimal widgets on my lock screen?

iPhone16ProMax,Minimalist camera bump leveler ,"Rocking my 16PM caseless and my only complaint is how unlevel the thing is on a surface when I tap to skip forward in whatever I’m listening to and it rocks on the flat surface.

Tried searching for what I’m looking for but don’t think anyone has made one (or I just haven’t found it yet.) So I’m putting it out here on Reddit in the hopes some enterprising person will get busy and make it and some $$ to boot. I can’t be the only one that doesn’t want to use a case and hates the unevenness.

I want a very minimal attachment to the back of the phone that levels out the back of the phone similar to the Pixel 9 - stick on, doesn’t attach to the sides or top and not part of a larger case - just a camera bump leveler so it sits on a flat surface and doesn’t rock back and forth when tapping the right side of the screen.

iPhone16ProMax,Get a new iPhone 16 pro max (it’s not your battery),"Hey wanted to make this post because I was having major battery issues with my brand new iPhone 16 pro max.  I shared similar issues with battery drainage with little screen time. It was driving me crazy. Also it got to the point where it would take hours to get to 100.  I took it to apple and was told it was not a battery issue, but some type of hardware issue.  The phone was not passing any diagnostics so he said he would change out the phone.  I got a new phone and it works as it should. 

I say that to say it possibly is hardware issue even though your phone is brand new.  I paid nothing for the replacement because I was still under warranty.  Hope this helps.

iPhone16ProMax,16pro vs pro max??,"So, I am in a pickle. I've done extensive research but I'm stuck between the two...

My main concerns is getting a iphone with 120hz, good storage (256 gb), battery, camera.

I noticed the pro max is just the same as pro yet a lot bigger, better battery, etc. Yet I was almost like that's great! My phone screen is 6'4, the PM is 6'9.. I have small hands my phone fits well in my hands enough and I don't want to deal with a heavy larger phone.

And I was thinking for ages oh the 16 plus would be up my ally and it is! But it's 60hz and I'm only looking for 120hz because that's what I use now and idk how clunky it would be, yet that was my first option and idea. 

So im stuck... the 16 pro 256 gb is only 100$ exactly in difference from PM, is it worth spending the extra 100$ 

I absolutely love everything about the new 16 models but I'm torn and I'm super adamant about battery which ik pro is bad with but if it's meeting all my requirements I don't mind carrying a charger.

I use my phone 247 so this is important and price matters to me.",2024-12-17 04:09:02,2024-12-17,15,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone16ProMax/comments/1hg2cva/16pro_vs_pro_max/

iPhone16ProMax,Let’s learn the difference between Drain -versus- Usage…,"I’ve seen a lot of posts and comments under my own about the phone not having great juice life, that it d/rai/ns quick and doesn’t last much. While the majority of us have had amazing experiences since day one, and surprisingly, it even got better after 18.2. There’s a difference between draining and usage. If your phone dies down quick WITHOUT any app/background usage, new software updates, your screen is off most of the day, and you have great cellular/wifi reception, then yes you might have problems. BUT if you are a heavy user who streams music or videos consistently, plays mobile/online games, have weak signal, scroll through social media all day, use navigation etc, it will obviously and logically consume far more juice than the average user and it will last less, and you can’t expect 3 days without having to charge it. Remember everyone’s patterns are different so you can’t expect the same outcome, or compare your experience with others in its entirety. My 16PM only “drains” quicker if I play some heavy online games, it drops 2-3% every 5 minutes I play, vibrant graphics and consistent data usage are big factors. Also if I’m listening to music through the loudspeaker as well. Or if I watch videos on YT Premium, Directv, or on social media apps. And also shooting pictures on Pro RAW mode when I’m traveling. But if I’m on my regular schedule at work and the screen is off most of the day, I barely lose 2-3% per hour. Nothing is running in the background unless I do it purposely. So make sure we know the difference between both terms. Also keep all your apps updated. Most apps have new updates from Monday through Wednesday every week, so check your App Store daily in the evening. Apps performance and permissions can also affect it and updates squash bugs and unruly behavior. In conclusion, if you use your phone as intended, it will last as it should. If you use it more than the average user, it will die down at a faster rate. But if you don’t use it at all, and it drops like crazy, then yes there is something in the background affecting it.

I replaced my iPhone 13 Pro Max to 15PM a month ago but it’s battery was much worse than the 13PM.

In compersion my wife just bought a 16 Plus and uses for work 10 hours a day (screen time) with 50% drain.

So I got a replacement 16PM but the situation isn’t much better, the 16PM does the half of the 16+ about 5 hours screen time with 50%. 

The second phone is in use since 2 weeks. I tried a lot of things to improve battery time like black mode, disabling locating, bluetooth, AOD, app refresh in background. I’ve deleted apps with screentime in the background like Facebook, and I removed my Apple Watch, but still the same.

iPhone16ProMax,New iPhone 16 PM,"I just want to start off with how much better the apps look and function on IOS, it’s absolutely crazy. I switched from a Samsung S23 Ultra that I’ve had for 2 years now and it was great at first but Samsung just won’t do any updates to make their phones UI feel any smoother or organized. My S23 Ultra was overheating constantly doing simple tasks and the battery life was atrocious so I decided to look into this phone and I can definitely say I’m team Apple again.

All my apps feel like they’re refreshed and open way quicker, the camera button isn’t as bad as others have complained about either. Face ID is way faster than it used to be and I’ve been using this phone since yesterday around noon and I’ve still got 61% battery after heavy usage. I’m newer to IOS again so if anyone has any tips or suggestions for a previous android user I would be glad to hear them.

iPhone16ProMax,One month review,"Battery, pros, cons & problems

Battery: Not that impressive, to be serious. I always gotten less than 7 hours of on-screen time , and need to charge every 12 hours ALMOST consistently ever since I updated to iOS 18.1.1. Just same like my 11 pro max

Pros: 
1) very fast charging using the RIGHT cable and charger. 2)Screen is bright, 
3) doesn’t lag,
4) data is faster than my 11 pro max (maybe due to 5G).
5) The Camera Zoom is quite impressive. 

Cons:
1)Too big even though I have big hands
2) you need to be careful to off iCloud backup or sync using mobile data if you have limited data
3) sometimes, when you launch some apps, it would restart for some unknown reason

Problem: My main camera lens is having problem, always taken super blurry image. So am sending back for repair or exchange. 

That’s all, out and over

iPhone16ProMax,Solution to screen touch problems  with iphone 16 Pro Max,"I think I might have a solution hoping others would try it too! If you goto camera control button settings in camera settings and goto to accessibility there's an option called Light -press force. Change it to lighter. As well as double light press speed to slower. I notice a significant difference in touch response. Not sure why maybe the side button sensitivity is somehow connected to the screen. Thanks hopefully someone can verify this fix!

Update: Possible permanent fix. Goto camera settings/camera control/turn camera option to none/ then goto accessibility at bottom/turn camera control off/ then hard reset(press top left volume button,the bottom volume and hold side button until apple logo appears). After restart turn all camera settings back on. This reset seen and read in many places has seemed to help many. It has fixed all of the issues I’ve had. Give it a try! It’s looks like it might be a software glitch with the side button.
Also suggestion use a thin screen protector. This is the thinnest I actually could find so far.

1. I don’t usually use the UW camera.

Now, he wants me to upgrade as a form of reward but I am not sure what to get. My phone is still good as new (no dents and sratches with 93% battery health) so it never crossed my mind to upgrade. 

- I am thinking of getting a Pro since I am planning to keep the 13 Pro Max as a backup phone. Here, I will have both sizes. 

- Another reason for getting a Pro is that I have an iPad if I need a bigger screen for media consumption. 

- I have small hands and I am already struggling with the old Pro Max size (6.7 inches)

I am posting on this sub to know if the comfort of Pro’s size (6.3 inches) is a good trade off against the bigger battery and screen of Pro Max. I already went to the store to feel both but I am still having a hard time deciding. 

# UPDATE
I got the 16 Pro Max. I went to the store ready to buy the PRO. I compared my 13 Pro Max to 16 Pro side-by-side (something that I did not do the first time) and I was underwhelmed the second time I saw Pro. At that moment, I was sure that I will miss the bigger screen so I went for Pro Max.

This shows as delays in sending pics over messages, downloading photos, etc. As an example, today I’m sitting in a coffee shop I’ve been to many times.
