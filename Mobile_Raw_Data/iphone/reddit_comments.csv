Occasionally there has been an iOS 18 version where i deemed battery life to be “acceptable” but most of these versions have felt like there is a leak somewhere that cannot be plugged, no matter how much you tinker with the settings and adjust how you use it. 
I fear with iOS 18.4 on the horizon right around spring (it’s the **BIG** update) that our battery woes will not be coming to an end anytime soon.

With that said, the only thing that needs protection are the glass around said lenses, given they aren’t made of sapphire and will break & fracture at any given fall at the most unfortunate bumpy surfaces (rocky terrain on a hike, random irregular surface, items on the ground, etc). It’s the main reason why I bought and use this $17 clear case more often than my Spigen Hybrid T case, since the former has outer camera glass protection and latter is basically just a hole with a raised lip (like most cases out there). Don’t get me wrong though, the Spigen case is still absurdly good af, since I find the capacitive camera control case button useful, hence I use the Spigen case whenever I’m going to social gatherings and the like.",2025-02-02 06:22:44,5

Hardware wise the iPhone is twice as fast as the pixel but both feel nice to use.

It's difficult to pick because the Processing on the pixel is killing my impression of it. iPhone its less subtle and modifying or editing images is easier. The preset filters are very nice.

My iPhone 16 PM has a screen that looks like is from a 2007 Nokia phone. Horrible viewing angles which is terrible because I tend to use my phone at an angle. It was so bad I went back to my 13PM because apple doesn’t see it as a defect when no other phone in the store does it. I don’t really think is fair to price something at 1500€ and be this inconsistent but the competition also has its problems (looking at you Samsung). I think I will try to sell my 16PM and buy a 15PM as they are not that different and have less variation in oled. Sorry for the rant but at this price point this is really frustrating.

* if there is enough light, it will use deep fusion, and the photos will be 24mp. In this mode, the photos are not bad in my opinion, but overprocessed + the micro contrast is aggressive
* when there isn't enough light OR if you manually set the obturation time to longer, then in it will not use deep fusion. The photos will be in 12mp, and the quality will be pretty mediocre, but at least not overprocessed. It may struggle quite a lot in making correct focus also

iPhone16Pro,From X to 16 Pro,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ic3blm,2025-01-28 14:55:03,m9wcqaz,"I've noticed a few things that helped my pics.

Using RAW, of course.

Getting a better camera app than the default. You can find camera apps that let you manually control the shutter speed and ISO, in 12mp mode at least (which is most likely what you'd be using for moon shots likely at 5x). I was able to get better moon shots by tweaking the ISO and shutter speeds. They weren't amazing, but pretty impressive for a phone at 5x. Oh, and those Samsung moon photos might be fake. They use AI to detect moons in your photo and overlay a high res photo of the moon over yours. It's no different than just slapping a moon photo over a white circle in Photoshop (an oversimplification).

Some camera apps will also let you deactivate Apple's post processing which, in my opinion, often makes your photos look worse by overly reducing noise, increasing contrast too much, and using some algorithm that makes your photos look weird and sorta like an oil painting when zoomed. When you first take a photo and look at it in your reel, you'll notice the image subtly (or not so subtly) change after about a second. That's the post processing kicking in and I hate it.

I use ProCam for my photos, but I think it's subscription based now. I bought it like 7 years ago when it was just a flat purchase so I think I bypassed the sub. It's really helpful for giving you a ton of control. You can also do fun stuff like long exposure photos for astrophotography and taking pics of moving water. The shame about these apps is that you can't just hit your camera button to pull them up, but ProCam at least does let you use the camera button once the apps open. You can slap a widget on your home screen for quicker access but it doesn't beat the ease of the camera button.

Hope this long-winded answer helps!",2025-01-29 21:41:35,2

It’s been a thing for quite a while now. Some photos do it more than others. For starters, make sure HDR is on or off depending on your preference. Also, you can go to the camera settings and enable the 48mp lens so all your pictures will look a bit more crisp. When I’m trying to take a very detailed picture, I’ll turn on RAW Max to get the best effect. If you look at my two recent posts, you can see the difference clearly between the RAW pictures, and the regular non-RAW. Granted, one is with flash on, while the other isn’t. But still. 

The thing with iPhones is you indeed get the best camera on the market (in my opinion), but they hide the pro features to the average user. I think this is a smart idea, considering the “Pro” features take up A LOT of storage/cloud space. Find a nice YouTube video which breaks down the features, and mess with what you like best.

 (In most cases , iuses copper rods or conductive glass, conductive glass is on par with Apple's own technology, & copper rods are a tad bit less sensitive - and some other companies use other solutions as well)

* Spigen Hybrid T (conductive glass) 
* Otterbox Lumen (conductive glass)
* Apple clear case (apple designed camera control)
* Apple silicone case (apple designed camera control)
* Beats by DRE (apple designed camera control)
* Spigen Tough Armour T  (conductive glass)
* Mous Limitless 6.0 (conductive glass with PCB - removable)
* Dbrand grip (copper rod)
* Dbrand ghost (copper rod)
* Ryan London (conductive glass)
* TineeOwl (conductive glass) 
* Encased Titan-X Holster \[rugged bulky case\] (conductive glass?)
* Benks montage, prestige and 600D (conductive glass)
* TAC Standard case 4.0 (Thin plastic layer)

I’m going to stick with my iPhone instead.

Sure, Apple isn’t as innovative as it used to be, and they’ve become more of a “continuist” company. But their ecosystem works really well, and the apps are designed much better for iOS than for Android.

And let’s be honest, “it just works” is pretty accurate. We’re in an era where smartphones hit the roof, and the choice between one or the other really comes down to your personal preferences and needs, not just innovation or features.",2025-01-24 06:14:55,2

- Burst mode
- ProRAW (edit afterwards, it’ll change the look)

Advertising things that your device can't to yet is crazy.  I'm not confident they'll fix it.  Siri is still just about useless and they've been working on that for quite some time now.

Alcohol wipes unfortunately are used very often. Most people have no issues, some do, and they’re the ones whose phones I’m fixing in my shop because they didn’t know - alcohol can get in the seams of an electronic device and weaken or break down the adhesive holding things together and providing the water resistant seal. It is not adviseable to use alcohol for cleaning phones unless very carefully and only on a flat surface, not near a seam. 

If you got the alcohol off your camera quickly and dried the device you should be fine, the alcohol can remove the oleophobic (oil/fingerprint resistant) coating on the display which is another reason not to use alcohol wipes, but the lenses do not have this oleophobic coating and shouldn’t suffer any adverse effects.",2025-01-18 23:50:30,1

Everything worked intuitively and without a hitch for years (although battery life did begin to shorten in the 4th year of ownership). 

I liked everything about the Galaxy except for the way its photo algorithm automatically over-sharpened my snapshots. They were good photos, just a little too crispy for my personal taste. **E**diting them softened them to the way I liked.

In December 2024 (last month!) I got my first iPhone - the 16 Pro. I switched from Samsung to iPhone because iPhone is the only phone with ""Voice Isolation,"" a feature I needed. (With Apple Voice Isolation, when you're are on the phone, the person on the OTHER end does not hear ambient noise around you on your end. This helps your listener hear you when you're in a noisy environment.)

Overall, I'm a bit disappointed with my 16 Pro. The good news is that the Voice Isolation feature works very well. But, given Apple's reputation for user-friendly design, I expected a sleeker more intuitive user interface. Seems to me that mastering the iPhone functions requires study. Will need to apply myself.

I also really miss the larger and more square screen of my Samsung Galaxy - much better for reading, streaming, and photo-editing. Turns out those things matter to me more than I knew. I never had any problem holding the Samsung and my hands are average size.

Of course, everyone has different tastes and needs. As for my opinion here, make of it what you like. (I expect I'll get used to my iPhone and feel better about it over time. If not, I'll pass it along to my husband and get another Samsung, a very good phone at a better price.)",2025-01-17 17:06:54,1

It's full of little improvements though 🤷🏻‍♂️

**Here are the biggest improvements over the 12 for me :**

* it rarely turns really hot, unlike the 12, which was prone to heat
* the speakers are way better, on the low spectrum especially
* battery life improvement is huge
* color management in camera has improved a lot from the greenish looking of the 12's photos + new photographic style are great
* the action button is a game changer
* a detail but the buttons on the 16 are more pleasant to use, noticeable on a day to day use. Better placed and more clicky
* the rounded corners, frosted back, titanium are really pleasant in hand
* having always on display is useful
* having usb-c, game changer

**For the deceptive things :**

* the low-light photo capabilities hasn't improved a lot
* I need further test, but I feel like the stabilisation is maybe better on the 12 (optical stabilisation, compared to sensor stabilisation on the 16pro)
* it's a bit heavy compared to 12, but not that big of a deal
* not really a bad point, and hot take, but 120hz despite being very noticeable, don't add anything more on a daily use, so not that important for me",2025-01-15 11:16:16,11

With how prevalent battery packs and USB-C cables are nowadays, I downsized because I'm no longer needing the biggest and baddest battery on the market.

For me, it was about carrying something more manageable, having more pocket room, and feeling like I'm not carrying a ""laptop"" in my pocket. While I will always believe the iPhone 13PM is one of the best/stoutest phones I've ever owned, this change has been a good one.

As for your questions. I've never had a Dynamic Island, so moving to the 16 Pro gave me a chance to try it out. The Dynamic Island is a neat feature, however, I wish more apps would utilize it. The camera I believe is better than the 13PM, and I'm quite happy with it. As a person who runs all their tech for efficiency and always trying to optimize them, I turned off the Always-On Display to preserve battery (and I just don't feel like it needs to be on 100% of the time when I have an Apple Watch). It could be me, but the 120Hz display (for me - please keep that in mind) I don't see much of a change. Perhaps I'm not using the correct apps to truly experience it? The only noticeable difference I see is that scrolling is smoother. Buttery smooth. That being said, the smoothness factor could be the 120Hz display doing its thing, but I just don't know enough about it to say 100% that's what it is. Hopefully someone else with more knowledge can elaborate on it.",2025-01-15 15:25:16,3

Honestly. I think the Dynamic Island is a downgrade. Don’t show any useful information and most importantly takes up more screen space then the old bus lane.

I turned off the always on display. The normal 16pro don’t have a big enough battery to waste energy.

120hz is of course nice. Not as much as on a computer screen. Where I have wasted to much money on always have the top tier. But it’s a nice upgrade. 

The camera is way better. love that they have given us more control. For the prosessing as all mobil camera nowadays is to aggressive. I love the camera button. iPhones should always had it. Annoyed me back in the days. Sadly the position is a little bit off. 

Could have used the 10s max one more year. But the low amount of ram (4gb) was too annoying. Always refreshing pages. Fear the 16pro with only 8 won’t age super well. Especially since apple intelligence will need more and more.

Cameras are noticeably better, I’m one of the few who actually likes the camera control so that helps too

Don’t use always on display, if it had the option to function like the Samsung always on display I would use it, but not in it’s current form

Turned off ProMotion because I didn’t notice any meaningful difference, so the little bit of power draw reduction by turning it off is more useful to me

Battery is capped at 80% and it lasts more than a day’s use, very impressive increase over my old phone

Camera bump is bigger which is annoying

The phone is slightly heavier

USB-C is annoying

Oh also if you watch 2:1 videos, the bottom of the Dynamic Island clips into the edge of the video slightly, I had thought they fixed this when they made the phone taller, but it still clips.  The old notch doesn’t clip at all",2025-01-16 13:18:19,3

I'm not even a heavy user, my screen time per day is about an hour lol. If you keep it charged everyday it should be fine. I doubt this is a bug, it's just because they put a smaller battery in the pro. Probably the most annoying thing about this phone for me. I turned the percentage number off to not look at it drop.

ios 18.1 was buggy as hell for me with constant touch freeze, and bluetooth stopped working. Many requires restarts to fix. Haven't noticed those problems yet with the new 18.2.1. I'd assume it's fixed.

The camera, umm. I'm not a big user of phone cameras, but when I take a picture I have to hold it really steady or else it's blurry. Idk if it's my settings or what because it's currently factory. Past phones I had didn't require my hands to be this steady :/ Not a big fan of it if I as a end user have to tweak it myself while other phones can do it out of the box. It looks fine when my hands are steady, but I'm no doctor can't do that all the time.

a lesser problem is depending on your current setup, you might need to shell out more money for wireless chargers (or magsafe). My desktop wireless charging stand AND my car's charging pad does not work with the 16 pro. This is due to the HUGE raised camera bump lol...Only fix is magsafe pretty much...",2025-01-15 09:02:47,3

Mine does the same thing. It also doesn’t recognize when I’m touching it about 30% of the time so I have to tap something sometimes up to seven times to get it to acknowledge it. I took it to Apple and they told me they’re aware of the problem and the more I report itthe sooner it gets fixed. I’ve had it since September.,2025-01-12 04:18:38,2

What this basically does it has a cooling system to ensure that the charging remains cooler, much cooler even than if using a cable.

Right now I’m using the Ultraglass Unbreak Top 9H+ off Amazon and I find it is doing pretty well. I too wanted something rounded so I wouldn’t feel the edge when swiping up or from the sides and also wanted something that went as close to the edge as possible. While not perfect, the edges in my opinion are the most rounded out of all I tried, and though it does cut off maybe a tiny bit of the screen, I can still see most of the guid lines in the photo preview which is better then the other protectors I tried. While it does still leave a small gap between the edge, I also like that it doesn’t seem to be a dust magnet like the other cases were. It also feels pretty soft to the touch and does fairly well at preventing smudges and finger prints. Overall I’m pretty happy with it.

I just switched over from a S24 Ultra to the 16PM. Everything I read online made it sound like the cameras were different but comparable.

It’s a Samsung thing.  The flip side of that is you don’t have to use any of it.  Pro mode in the same camera is a toggle you could easily choose to never turn on and just use it as a point and shoot.  

It is very positive to say Apple is encouraging devs to include more features. What I would say though is why include all this capability and push me to third party apps to utilize it.  Some of which aren’t free.  Samsung phones have a lot of features but until you enable the pro mode it’s as simple as the iPhone camera UI.  I see hindering your own software and requiring users to go to third party options as kind of anti consumer and counter intuitive, especially for a product that prides itself on its native ecosystem as much as Apple does.",2025-01-06 23:43:15,2

**For video**
Record Video: ofcourse the 4k120fps will give you the best quality but it will eat up alot of storage ~800mb/minute. You can opt for 4k30fps, the frame rate commonly used in movie are around 30fps too because more frame-rate do make it smoother but everything will appear slower

**For picture**
 Format -> Make sure proraw & resolution is on -> Pro default -> Choose HEIF MAX 
This will capture 48MP. However it will reset to off by default so you need to go to back to the main camera setting->Preserve setting -> Make sure proraw & resolution control is on.

FINAL STEP: open camera app (what you usually do to take picture). Their will be HEIF Max on the top right of the screen and make sure it’s enabled. From now on, under good light condition, your iPhone will take picture at the highest picture quality of 48MP",2025-01-05 05:53:23,3

I used to have phones last me 3 days without charging with light usage. But this phone I got to charge it almost everyday or so, my habits did not change.

not a big camera guy, but the close up/ normal camera mode auto flicker is a little new to me. Not a big fan of that. But the picture quality is pretty good. The camera button is interesting, but it's a little tricky to get it working sometimes sliding it, I was hoping for it to be a bit more sensitive.

iOS 18.2 also have some odd things happening on my phone. Like bluetooth suddenly stops working, had to restart the phone to resolve it. Also once the phone just won't respond to touch inputs, also had to restart it.

Since I upgraded to this phone. I never gotten a full bar of service lmao...it doesn't stop me from being able to use it normally, so I guess it shouldn't bother me. I just find it funny.

My biggest problem with the phone is the camera bump. None of my wireless pads work with this phone, the bump is too thick to get a good contact with it. It just flat out doesn't work with my car's charging pad, the sweet spot is too small for it to work as I drive around town. Likely have to buy magsafe stuff, but still a bummer I have to shell out extra $ to just wireless charge it as I have everything setup already :(

higher refresh rate screen is probably the only thing I liked since upgrading from an iphone xs. Other than that, nothing much really changed for me.",2025-01-04 11:01:09,3

The S24U battery will already last longer than the 16P even if your copy was super efficient. Plus, the Galaxy has one of the best displays around.

If you still decide on the 16P just to try something new, it is a solid device and one of the better devices for retaining its value, longer.

I have both including the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, Xperia 1 VI, Vivo X100U and base 16. As much as I think the S24U is the better overall phone, especially for Androids, it is still the phone I like the least based on camera system alone, which is at the top of my list for why I have Androids.

The S24U will obviously last longer than the 16P even if you had a copy that was super efficient. Plus, it has one of the best displays around.

Currently, my main phone is the base 16 (which is always an iPhone) while my secondary device is the Vivo (mainly for its cameras). The Xperia is my second choice.

I’ll probably be dropping the Galaxy and Xiaomi Ultras from my yearly upgrades since they aren’t going in the direction I care for with their cameras. I’ll continue to support Vivo with their Zeiss collab, and Sony because of how similar their camera system is to their Alpha cameras.",2025-01-04 01:39:25,2

I noticed some captured pictures, there’s like black rectangle on the upper left side. It takes like 1/4 of the pic (16:9 aspect ratio). Different environments, lighting, and location. So this happened multiple times. 

FaceID sucks in this ios version. FR! 

Delays in notifications! I noticed that I receive notifs on my watch (series 9) faster than my phone. It’s almost late like 10s+. Also, I think there’s like a connectivity/continuity bug, took a screenshot on my watch, the image popped up on my phone camera roll after a few days. 

And just this day, my lock screen wallpaper is gone. Phone is not on low power mode, focus, or DND. Lock screen wallpaper is simply gone. Restarted my phone, on/off AOD, not solved. I just simply lost my lock screen wallpaper but I still have the widgets. Any wallpaper that I use for my lock screen is simply gone. Even the stock wallpaper.

It’s a great phone but you are locked down a bit more on iOS. I’ve had the phone for less than a week after being on Android for years. Switched mostly due to family constant nagging. 

Camera is great, apps run fast, fits in hand nicely, and I can keep easily in front pocket with a thin case. Most apps seem to be available except for APKs for apps with less tracking you can get on Android. There are ways to stop some Apple tracking, but it’s there. Same with Google.

CarPlay is weird with Siri (Siri won’t answer basic questions), notification badges don’t work in email apps (Outlook and Proton Mail with push and notifications enabled).  

The phone is great overall. Minimal bloatware unlike you get with Samsung. I downloaded Google photos, Google notes, and Google Authenticator (stay away from Microsoft Authenticator. I don’t see a way to transfer between platforms.)

The shock absorption is impressive, providing great cushioning for drops. It’s rated for 13 feet of drop protection, which I’ve unfortunately tested by accident—my 16PM came out completely fine. It’s MagSafe compatible and has a very tall lip around the front screen and cameras.

Unfortunately Tech 21 cut out a giant slice all the way to the front screen for the Camera Control. There’s zero protection of a huge chunk making a large amount of my front screens edge unprotected. I’d upload photos but it appears I can’t. 

My recommendation is the Speck Presidio2 Grip (without ClickLock) as it has a solid frame with an oval cutout for Camera Control access which protects the edge of the phone.

I got my 16 Pro 3 days ago and have experimented with photographic styles. I have to say, they’re pretty good and the most unexpected feature I didn’t know would make me enjoy shooting so much. I’m in love with Gold, Quiet, Dramatic and Ethereal. Gold is my default I set up under camera settings. It gives me some Kodak Gold/Reggie’s Portra 400 vibes. I just love shooting with it at -60 tone, +5 color and 100 palette. In fact, I’m selling my XE4 while prices are high and invest in a XT5 later on since my iPhone is a more practical portable and compact camera. If Apple continues to improve this feature, I’m pretty sure we will have a FujiXWeekly equivalent for iPhone shooters, that would be amazing and would sell even more iPhones (maybe that’s the plan 🤔).

Of course, they don’t compare, one can’t replace the other in all situations. Fuji is the better camera with amazing colors, but I came to the realization that for I used it for (I’m not a professional photographer) I’m better of with just the iPhone 16 Pro. I love physical buttons and the analog feel, but iPhone is just way more versatile for me: 

- I don’t have to regret not having a good camera with me at all times. It’s always in my pocket
- Same for lenses. Turns out my iPhone has 3 (6 focal lengths equivalents).
- I love editing photos, but to an extent. That’s what I love about Fuji, the SOOC jpegs. I just want to shoot and have fun, focusing on the artistic aspects, like composition, instead. And the iPhone not only produces excellent colors, it also has HDR, Live Photo, etc. Way better tool for creating memories in my opinion. Plus, if I want to shoot something and edit it heavily, I can just turn on ProRaw.

I could go on, but you get my point, and I think we’re on the same boat. Though, hold onto your X100V if you have a specific use case for it, you need the benefits the bigger sensor or can’t give up the analog feel. It’s a great camera. I wanted the X100V at first, but it was out of stock everywhere so ended up with the XE4. I will sell it because I know it will just collect dust, losing value overtime, and if i want a “real” camera might as well invest in a big powerful one.",2024-12-30 12:21:02,3

Got my brand new 16PM a month ago - turned off the screen, turned on the black mode, no geolocations, no screen time running, using WIFI - 90% of the time, turned of Apple intelligence, mostly not using YouTube, Instagram and Tick Tok, just messangers, Apple Music and a browser, not playing games at all - and I get 8-10 hours of an average usage from 100% to 10-15%.

IOS 18.3.

Any thoughts ?

iPhone16ProMax,Charging while on FT,https://i.redd.it/n8pnpg01cghe1.jpeg,2025-02-06 05:07:43,mba8av2,"Ai has the answer lol 

Yes, this issue is likely due to the power limitations and efficiency of MagSafe charging combined with the high power demand of FaceTime (FT). Here’s why it happens:

1. MagSafe Efficiency and Power Output
	•	MagSafe charging is less efficient than wired USB-C charging due to energy loss from wireless transmission.
	•	Even though your charger is 30W, MagSafe can only deliver up to 15W (or lower depending on heat and power conditions).

2. High Power Consumption During FaceTime
	•	FaceTime uses a lot of power due to continuous video processing, screen-on time, and network activity (Wi-Fi or cellular).
	•	If power consumption exceeds what MagSafe can deliver, the battery drains despite being connected.

3. Thermal Regulation & Charging Behavior
	•	Apple devices prioritize managing heat during charging. If MagSafe charging causes heat buildup, the system may slow down charging to prevent overheating.
	•	Your observation that the MagSafe charger didn’t get warm during FaceTime suggests that the system was limiting charging to control temperature.
	•	After hanging up, when the phone is less active, the charger heats up and resumes normal charging.

4. Why USB-C Charging Works Normally
	•	USB-C is more efficient and can deliver a higher, more stable wattage (20W–30W+), making it sufficient to both power the device and charge the battery.
	•	USB-C also generates less waste heat, allowing for sustained charging even under high power draw.

Possible Solutions
	1.	Use a higher-wattage wired charger (e.g., 30W+ USB-C to Lightning/MagSafe cable).
	2.	Reduce FaceTime brightness and close background apps to lower power consumption.
	3.	Use a cooling fan or place the phone on a cooler surface to prevent thermal throttling.
	4.	Try an official Apple MagSafe charger (some third-party chargers may not consistently deliver max power).",2025-02-06 12:51:53,1

Photo editing software is one of the most competitive in the industry. As each new “gee whiz” feature is released by on manufacturer all of the others immediately try to best them.

In comparing two notable AI photo editing applications…Topaz Photo AI and DxO Pure RAW, each product is targeting a small subset of image enhancement…mainly noise reduction, sharpening and blur reduction.

While each is trying to produce the superior product to the other, the end results are similar, yet not exact!

Cameras are some of the best on a phone same with battery life and screen etc. The majority that are happy are too busy with their phones to post about their happiness and it’s easier to whine and complain about having a dud or other issues.,2025-01-31 19:26:11,5

Probably have to highlight that Reddit is a vastly small minority of iPhone users who owns the 16 pro max and when people do have issues with their phones, they will flock online to communities to find and check if other people have those same issues.  

I’m not trying to discredit the issues that people have here as there are definitely valid ones which is always good to be aware of. Just…. take everything with a pinch of salt. The vast majority of people who probably got the phone are just happily using with no issues as compared to people who have issues and are actively on Reddit to inquire. 

There is also a bunch that seems almost overly obsessed with things like battery life where it seems like user anxiety over actual problems OR they actually have major issues with their phones but somehow are not replacing their devices and just complaining on Reddit when they have a defective unit that ISNT suppose to function like that lol. 

Chill with reading all the doom and gloom. Test out the phone yourself. Give the phone TIME to adjust to your routine and optimise the battery. Check for flaws and defects esp major ones that you might have seen here and THEN decide to either replace your device or returning it if you can.",2025-01-31 17:23:12,8

Display- excellent. Feels slightly smoother. Not sure if placebo. 

Battery - indestructible. Went on an outing and used navigation and camera all day. Could only get it down to 18 percent 

Camera - slightly better. Initially missed 3x zoom but enjoying the 5x now for portraits. Camera button feels like a waste of time. I like how I can edit photos in portrait mode of people even when I didn't shoot it in portrait mode.",2025-01-31 11:07:26,8

Screen is great, camera plus the dedicated button gives a plus, performance is nearly perfect I’ve been using battery saver option for more than a week and I haven’t had any lags or so.

But you could save some bucks if you replace the battery plus speakers and stick with it until the 17.

13 Pro needs battery + speakers

Biggest change though is the gaming performance for me. I play games alot on my phone like genshin, and I can run them pretty much on the highest setting, where compared to the 13 pro max I had to turn down some settings.

they messed up the battery life bad on this for me , but i think it’s only a software issue. i even turned off Hey Siri finally , but if all my other devices ran fine with all the same settings on (except maybe Apple Intelligence) than this should do the same. battery life has been terrible for me & the majority of people i see online. hopefully they fix it w a software update soon because this is ridiculous. it’s worse than my 14 Pro Max battery was after 2 years of wear by a LOT.",2025-01-25 09:55:47,0

Turn off Background Refresh for all apps you don’t use,
Turn off Roaming,
30 sec screen off,
Screen brightness if too much turn down,
Haptic feedback off,
I turn off app auto updates and check once per day,
All I can think of to still enjoy all the phone has to offer.

I’m sure there are more but this is my take and I last all day easy……hope this helps

I find it funny that in this test the guy used 150nits - you can't see shit with 150nits and with that it's supposed to last almost 18h with safaris browsing via 5G. so realistically, expect half of this. if you disable Siri&intelligence, turn off background refresh & location service (only when using apps such as maps) and use dark mode wherever you can, you can up your SOT considerably. 

honestly, after almost going insane with this battery fuckery over the past month, I suggest you just enjoy your phone which is the elite on the market right now. if it can get you through the day with still 30% remaining before you plug it in again, you're fine. if not, well... here we go again 🌚",2025-01-18 08:52:43,7

This was a VERY heavy day of use yesterday. I had no work in the office as we cleaned all our deals up so I was scrolling all day. Mind you, my connection was very very poor in the office. I can only manage to get 1 bar of 5G in there.

It really depends on a lot of factors with connection, screen brightness, if you’re using Bluetooth or not (I was), and if you have optimized your settings at all to squeeze out more juice(turning off push notifications for mail, background app refresh off, location services, etc).

If I have a busy day at work and I’m not on it much, I’m getting two days out my phone easily. I could very well stretch it possibly 2.5 work days but that’s very minimal use. But most cases I’m falling asleep at the end of a work day with 50-60 percent battery. Worst case I go to bed with 20 percent or so and I’m charging it. But that’s rare.",2025-01-18 13:40:43,5

A big part of it is that people on here are just using their phones too dang much.

With that said, my theory is that everyone is using Apple's new battery limiter feature to try and preserve the battery life on their new expensive purchase. So you see almost everybody who's posting with their battery at a 90% limit or even 80% limit. Aside from the obvious fact that limiting your battery by 20% will give you 20% less battery life (duh) Apple software has not fully learned how to estimate the percentage of a battery that is not being charged to 100 on a regular basis. 

I personally have also hopped on the 80% bandwagon for the reason I described above – I would like my battery to last longer. my 13 mini that this phone replaced had 76% battery life when I traded it in. I think one of the reasons it dropped off so badly was because I always drove around in the car with the phone plugged in at 100% battery.

It is still nice though how when something works on iphone, it WORKS. On android many things work perfectly until they don’t and then you have a big problem because one of your incoming text messages has disappeared into thin air and you can’t get it back and never got to read it (happened to me 4 times). I will say though, when something doesn’t work on ios, it’s way more annoying to fix. That's assuming you can find a way to make it function in the first place.

Plus it makes sense for you considering you are already invested in the ecosystem.

iPhones are still the benchmark for longevity. I haven't faced any issues with the iPhones I've owned in the past. Also, the resale value is slightly higher. I find the battery life on my 13Pro more than adequate. Pro Max models certainly have a much higher capacity. (I ruined a lot of my battery health though endless hours of PUBG - still find it perfectly usable after 3 years at 84% battery health.)

I'm in the same situation - just opposite. I have used iPhones for the past 8 years (6s, 8plus, and 13pro) and I'm considering to get the S25 Ultra later this year when the price drops on Amazon. I've had the same home screen for all those years. I added the widgets to the second page (muscle memory). For me, OneUI would be a refreshing experience - as iOS would be for you.

Ultimately it's your choice - can't go wrong with either. They are flagships for a reason!",2025-01-09 00:03:30,3

Fast charging is great when you’re in a hurry, but it heats up the battery more, which isn’t great for its health. Stuff like wireless charging or using a slower charger is gentler and doesn’t get as hot, so it’s better if you’re just charging overnight or don’t need it super quick.

Also, make sure you’ve turned on Optimized Battery Charging in your settings—it helps slow things down when your battery gets close to full so it lasts longer.

Basically, fast charging is fine if you need it, but slower charging is a good habit to keep your battery happy in the long run!",2025-01-08 04:32:21,2

The battery’s on these phones are not all that great in my opinion. And, if you are using AI features that drains battery like crazy too. Just being in the playground app drains 1% battery per minute. Your battery health also states it is normal, so doesn’t appear you have any battery issues. If you want to double confirm even, you can always bring it in to the Apple Store. They can diagnose battery issues.

The newer model of phones honestly are not as great as the older models. iPhone XR was the best iphone I had with the best battery life. Reason being is phones keep getting more and more powerful with each new release, and the battery capacity is not enough to keep up with that power, so drains more. Hopefully with time they will find a way to preserve the battery life again, but as of right now they are not the greatest.",2025-01-02 00:35:53,1

One of the cool features on the 16PM is that you can set a charging limit because charging the battery to 100% every time will start to degrade the battery health. Just go to Settings>Battery>Charging. I have my limit set to 85%.

If you want to charge to 100% there is an option called ""Optimized Charging"" which will charge your phone to 80% when it's idle, and it will only charge it to 100% if you start using your phone while its plugged in.

I would also turn off the ""Always On"" display feature. Go to Settings>Display and Brightness, and scroll down and you'll see the toggle switch.

Also, during the night I would highly recommend enabling the ""reduce white point"" feature, which you can find in the ""Accessibility"" menu, just go to Settings>Accessibility>Display & Text Size and scroll down to ""Reduce White Point"". It will reduce the power drain from your screen. And you can easily setup a button in the control center to toggle it on and off.",2024-12-29 16:37:30,2

Before 18.2 update I didn't have any sim and it lasted 2 days. I was still using wifi and all apps. After update it went to 1 day and I also started using it as my main phone with 2 sims Auto 5g. Now switched to 4g.  But I don't see any difference.  I also feel like the battery life has dropped after update but I'm not 100% sure because I have 2 sims now.

Oh and I was using Samsung flip 5 before and it had 3hr SoT. I had to charge it thrice a day and almost got lost once because the battery died.  Definitely better and now I get around 6hr SoT.

I left this info below as a comment on someone else’s post, here is a revised copy:

I came from the 14 Pro Max, and I have to say I’m completely disappointed. My 14 Pro Max had terrible battery life, went from 100% Battery Health to 82% Battery Health in less than a year and a half with just very basic day-to-day use. I upgraded to the 16 Pro Max for both a better battery and camera - The camera is a lot better, but my battery is much worse than my previous phone, even with 100% Battery Health. ALSO - to add, iOS 18.2 I think has made it worse now that I think back on the week/so that I had it prior to 18.2 releasing. The Home & Lock Screen syphons 20%+ of my battery life every single day, and I’ve tested endless settings across my phone to see what causes it and nothing changes. I have tried for weeks. I’ve had the phone less than 30 days. I’ve completely reset it and started fresh from a Mac wipe, and still have the same issues. Also, different apps that I used to be able to use before on my old iPhone 14 Pro Max make this 16 Pro Max EXTREMELY hot. From DoorDash to Spark Mail to just a simple phone call, basic activities turn this phone into a handheld microwave.",2024-12-29 21:54:50,2

Camera button didn’t prove itself useful, 4k120 is nice but I cannot use cameras other than main one in that mode. But my biggest gripe is that 16PM stutters a lot. 15PM just feels smoother. I even recorded app opening animation in slow-mo to prove my point and yes, 15PM renders them well while a very choppy display is easily observed on 16PM.

My 14 Pro Max had terrible battery life, went from 100% Battery Health to 82% Battery Health in less than a year and a half with just very basic day-to-day use. I upgraded to the 16 Pro Max for both a better battery and camera - The camera is a lot better, but my battery is much worse than my previous phone, even with 100% Battery Health. 

The Home & Lock Screen syphons 20%+ of my battery life every single day, and I’ve tested endless settings across my phone to see what causes it and nothing changes. I have tried for weeks. I’ve had the phone less than 30 days. I’ve completely reset it and started fresh from a Mac wipe, and still have the same issues. Also, different apps that I used to be able to use before on my old iPhone 14 Pro Max make this 16 Pro Max EXTREMELY hot. From DoorDash to Spark Mail to just a simple phone call, basic activities turn this phone into a handheld microwave. 

I have an appointment at an Apple Store 3 hours away next week to see about a repair at a Genius Bar, or a replacement.

P.S. - I also bought a brand new MacBook Pro 16” this year, a few months ago. Almost exactly 30 days in, the screen went out and I had to have it replaced, too. It’s been a terribly unlucky year for Apple purchases for me.",2024-12-25 14:51:08,2

People just want to forget about all of the settings, simply use their phone as much as they want in a day and still have battery left for the next day.

Charge your iphone, charge your watch, charge your ipad, brush your teeth, eat dinner, watch your favourite show, talk to friends/family and all after a long work day...

I don’t even know if this is true but every single time it lasts longer for me if I don’t run it into the ground for an hour right away. Then use it as normal.

These app developers have not been able to optimize their apps to the new iOS and iPhone’s 120hz ProMotion until this day. If you feel the phone is getting hot, it’s gonna be while you’re using a specific app. Force close it and you’re gonna notice how it goes back to regular temperature really quick. If it was an iPhone issue, it will be hot 100% of the time, which doesn’t happen. I only feel that with certain apps and as soon as I close them, my phone goes back to cold within 2 minutes or less. But 18.2 is a must in my opinion.",2024-12-24 03:54:17,4

I got my 16PM and first 2 ish days it’d get really hot and after that it hasn’t gotten hot at all. 18.2 isn’t bad at alll for me I still get thru the whole day w a full charge until I go to bed I’ll charge it again (I wake up at 530am) so it gets me thru the full day with heavy usage.

You drained ~25% of your battery during this point.   Other than that it seems ok.  Look at your app usage on bottom and turn off extra stuff you dont need on for some apps.   Personally I wouldn’t have a 5g phone and use LTE on it to conserve battery life.

When you did the set up did you transfer your old data from last iPhone or iCloud?   That seems to make a huge difference for folks experiencing battery problems like myself.   Apple was not helpful at all when confronted why I  am not getting remotely close to 33% advertised battery life.   In fact my iPhone 7plus with 78% battery capacity conserves battery better esp when it’s idle,   My 16 PM drains at a faster rate on idle than most folks",2024-12-19 04:25:01,4

- 128gb capacity increased to 256gb
- Battery life (actual) is about 30% longer than the pro version (depending on how you use it, the difference may be more or less)
- The screen size is larger than 0.6"", which means you can manipulate and view content better, especially important if you have large hands.
- Graphene heatsink is larger, but the battery does not have a metal cover. So perhaps this is not considered a differentiating factor compared to the pro version.
- The position of the camera control button is more convenient to press than the pro version. I think this is a point that few people pay attention to, unless you use this button a lot.

I'm using 16prm, battery life is what I'm most impressed with out of all the points mentioned above. I can use it for 1.5 days (with over 14 hours on-screen) on a single full charge (iphone is now again in the top phones with the best battery life, but not top 1)",2024-12-17 04:57:48,12

And if I’m not mistaken, the more you use iPhone, it starts to recognize what times you use the phone the most so when you have it on the charger overnight, it will start to trickle charge say around 1am and make sure it’s done charging shortly before you wake up for the day.

They're getting more and more rugged or foolproof so less to worry about. But in general there are still truths about them.

Things that make battery life worse, in order of significance:

1. Heat.

2. High number of Cycle Counts (number of full recharges over time.)

3. Going to 0%.

4. Going below 20%.

5. Going to 100% and staying there for long periods -- not incidentally, but as a regular habit.

6. Going above 80%.

7. Recharging through MagSafe.

Things that make battery life better, from best to worst:

1. Low Cycle Counts.

1. Not using battery at all when using it. That is, running it off external AC power while using it.

2. Not using battery at all when not using it. That is, running off AC power when the phone is sleeping.

3. Settings > Battery. Set it to stop charging at 80%.

4. Keeping the battery between 40% to 60%.

5. Keeping the battery between 20% and 80%.

6. Settings > Battery > Optimized battery charging (doesn't go over 80 until it thinks you're about to start you day.)

7. Recharging wired through the wall.

You don't have to go OCD and try to implement all of them. The more bad things you avoid and the more good things you do, adds up to some small benefits. I guess I'd say you're only in trouble if you're checking off everything on the bad list while getting no good boy checkmarks.

For me, I get really good results by keeping it on wired AC charger that never goes past 80%, when not in use, or near me at a desk. And when I notice and it's below 40% and it's not inconvenient, throwing it on a wired charger. By doing it this way, my battery only grows older for two things: when I'm using it wireless, or when it's recharging. And the latter is usually not so often because of the habits above.

You don't have to be as crazy as me though. Just aware of the principles and veer toward the good ones when it's more convenient, while avoiding a regular habit out of the bad ones.",2024-12-10 08:03:45,1

There are so many variables that affect battery life. You can use your iPhone while plugged in when you are home. This won’t put wear on the battery.

Typically you don’t want to regularly drain it to 20% daily, it puts more wear on the battery. I carry a usbc power bank and charge it if it gets low while I’m out, so I don’t have to wait till I get home at night. And in the car, it’s always on a charger.",2024-12-08 06:12:39,2

My 16PM gets about 15 hours of screen on time...but I use auto brightness, no AOD, 4G instead of 5G, etc.

Why is this important?
Coz:
1. They are cheaper and more durable than Apple cases
2. Heat dissipation is far better with the Spigen cases when you use a magsafe power bank which makes it more convenient to hold a phone as it doesnt get much hotter
3. Apple devices are meticulously designed but their cases arent, which makes them look like more of a style statement than serving it’s actual purpose.",2024-11-30 14:06:24,7

I’ve tried them all. This is my hands down fav, even though it doesn’t have a camera button cover. Otterbox, CaseMate, Andar, UAG, Apple and Spigen to name a few. All of them had some sort of compromise such as being too sharp on the bottom, or creaks and most of the cutouts for the button were either too big or too small. The Apple cases are nice and your best bet if you want the button covered. This case has a finger pillow as well and it’s a godsend (IFYKYK!).

Decided to treat myself to a little early Christmas present to myself. If you have the 15 Pro and it’s too small for your hand and you don’t like the color then upgrade to something you like. No sense in keeping or using something you don’t like. My 15PM was blue and I loved the color. I ended up getting the 16PM in black. The 16PM is slightly bigger than the 15PM but you don’t notice it until you put certain cases on it. If you have the funds to do so I say go for it.,2024-11-26 02:12:09,1

iPhone16ProMax,Excessive battery consumption for low SOT?,https://i.redd.it/vl6dbvh4rq2e1.jpeg,2024-11-24 00:08:08,lyoboqi,"It might be worth charging your phone to 100% and keeping Optimized Battery Charging on. By limiting the charge to 85%, the iPhone might not get a clear picture of the battery’s maximum capacity, which can impact how efficiently it manages power over time.

Additionally, let the phone power off completely once—this helps recalibrate the battery and ensures the phone has an accurate reading of its actual capacity.

For the next week or so, try using the phone more intensively than usual. This gives the system a better idea of your typical usage patterns and allows it to optimize charging and battery performance more effectively.

I was in the same situation as you, and after following these steps, my battery life improved significantly. Now I get 13 hours of SOT even with heavy usage. Try it, and I’m sure you’ll notice a big difference!",2024-11-24 02:04:14,7

Seems like more users are having the same problem with 18.1.1, maybe that is why Apple is holding off for the next RC update for 18.2
